The Saints last home defeat in Europe came at former home The Dell against Sporting Lisbon back in 1981.

But despite falling behind to Mauro Icardi's smart volley and Dusan Tadic missing a first-half penalty, Virgil van Dijk's volley and a  Yuto Nagatomo own-goal earned a vital win.

A win in the Czech capital or on Hapoel Be'er Sheva's visit to the South Coast should see them through.
STATS, FACTS, GOALS AND LOLS

Claude Puel left us in no doubt as to where his priorities lie after ringing the changes for this key clash.
Ryan Bertrand, Jose Fonte, Charlie Austin, Steven Davis and Jordie Clasie were all left out despite the Saints needing a win.
Indonesia-backed Inter headed to St Mary's as rumours circle that Southampton are set to become the latest club to be bought out by Asian investors. Chinese firm Lander Sports Development Co have been linked with a £200m takeover.

Nathan Redmond was snubbed by interim England boss Gareth Southgate for his latest squad. The pacey winger looked lively again after a solid start to the season causing problems down both flanks with Andros Townsend in particular lucky to be included ahead of the ex-Norwich man.
Southampton are unbeaten at St Mary's in Europe - their last defeat in continental competition came against Sporting Lisbon at the Dell in 1981.
Inter scored with their only shot on target in Milan and repeated the feat again today as Mauro Icardi showed why he is one of Europe's hot properties with a neat left-footed finish to round of the Italian's first real attack.

Southampton were fortunate to be given a penalty on the stroke of half-time but less lucky to see spot-kick king Samir Handanovic - who boasts 22 saves from 12 yards in Serie A - between the sticks. Dusan Tadic stepped up with Charlie Austin warming the bench.
Polish ref Pawel Gil compounded his error when he failed to send off Antonio Candreva for elbowing Sam McQueen in the face.

Italy's struggling rugby team could do worse than sign up Andrea Ranocchia for the Six Nations after the centre-back's superb effort to haul down Virgil van Dijk defending a Saints corner.
After two penalty shouts, Van Dijk got his reward as he volleyed home on the rebound after Oriol Romeu hit the bar.
Frank De Boer's sacking has done little to help Inter who crumbled after the equaliser and saw nervy left-back Yuto Nagatomo slice into his own net.
