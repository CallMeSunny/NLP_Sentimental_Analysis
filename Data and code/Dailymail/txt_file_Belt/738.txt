Some may associate Old Trafford more with prawn sandwich eaters than hearty singers, but this weekend's Premier League action appears to show that those inside Manchester United's stadium know how to belt out a song better than most.In the wake of Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho saying he felt his side had been 'playing in an empty stadium' last weekend, debate has raged about possible reasons behind any crowd apathy.Ticket prices have been put forward as mitigation, as have all-seater stadiums and a growing number of day-trippers to grounds.         Manchester United fans at the Stretford End of Old Trafford make their voices heard at the stadium In a bid to try and see if Mourinho's words were true of other Premier League grounds, Press Association Sport armed its reporters with a the 'Sound Meter' smartphone application which would attempt to record decibel levels at this weekend's games.While this level of research can in no way be considered scientific and is nothing more than a rough guide, it does indicate that United and Crystal Palace fans made more of a din than any others by as many as six decibels, although for balance there were 30,000 more fans there than anywhere else.In the interests of fairness, all samples were taken from kick-off to the 60-second mark, the highest recorded point has been used and, as no goals were scored in this period, the decibel levels can be considered to have been generated in similar circumstances.         Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho recently criticised Blues fans for the lack of atmosphere at Stamford Bridge The recordings will be repeated at the next round of Premier League games in order to gather readings from every ground.Here are the results, with accompanying reference points from our reporters.
