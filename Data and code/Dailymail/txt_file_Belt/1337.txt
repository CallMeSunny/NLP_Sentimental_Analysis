Friman told the court that she arranged a meeting between the two men after Bravo threatened to kill himself. ‘I cared about anyone who claimed they were suicidal,’ she told the court.As part of her testimony, Friman also read entries from Bravo's journal. ‘No one will stop me,’ the suspected killer wrote. ‘I will get out of Miami and into Gainesville by January 2013 and I will get her back.’        Star witness: Erika Friman, the girlfriend of victim Christian Aguilar, continues her testimony from the previous day during the murder trial Wednesday                      Emotional: Ms Friman detailed for the court Wednesday how she started dating Aguillar in college but decided not to tell Bravo about it to spare his feelings           Sealed with a kiss: Friman, the girlfriend of victim Christian Aguilar, blows a kiss back to the Aguilar family  Prosecutors say on September 21, 2012, Pedro Bravo spent 13 minutes strangling Christian Aguillar in a Wal-Mart parking lot before burying the body.  Aguilar's skeletal remains were discovered in October 2012 - several weeks after his murder - by hunters in forest off State Road 24 near Cedar Key in Levy County.
