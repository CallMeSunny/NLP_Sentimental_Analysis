 She said: ‘Bull riding is one of the most dangerous sports because you're up against an animal and you don't know what he is going to do or what he's thinking.‘You will get bulls that are meaner than others but you really have to respect them. You can't ride against them, you have to ride with them.’ Maggie's path to the bull ring began four years ago in her hometown of Shastsburg, Michigan, when a family friend who used to ride bulls took her to a rodeo and she was hooked.      Ready to do: Maggie prepares her ropes by adding rosin, making it sticky enough to get a better grip for holding on while being bucked by the bull before heading for the chute in Santa Maria, California        Hold on tight: Maggie needs to stay on the bull for eight seconds in order to score in a rodeo        Bull-ied: Although Maggie is barely 5ft 5in, she regularly takes on bulls that weigh over 2,000 lbs        Going, going, gone: Maggie has her rope in a rights grip and tries to hold her balance aboard the animal as the bull runs and bucks Aged 17 she left home to live in the southern states, working on ranches in Oklahoma and Texas to fund her bull riding training, and recently moved to Santa Maria, California, to be trained by top mentor Gary Leffew. Maggie says her parents are supportive of her unusual career path - despite the obvious dangers. But desite winning plaudits as a female in a predominantly male sport, Maggie says she still faces difficulties in being accepted - especially when she gets bucked off a bull.VIDEO Professional rider Maggie can handle bulls up to 2000lb!                 Rough ride: The 20-year-old left her family behind in Michigan and moved to California in order to become a better bullrider       Rough ride: In order for Maggie to qualify to be a professional bullrider she needs to stay on the bull for more than eight seconds She said: ‘They [men] say, "This is why girls shouldn't ride bulls and girls aren't made for this." But it all depends on the person.‘You're either a good bull rider or you're not. It takes a long time to gain people's respect and get treated the same as the men.‘Sometimes it's been harder for me because when you're learning how to ride a bull you're going to get bucked off - and you're going to get hurt. It's just not going to look very pretty while you're riding.’She now wears a full face mask and helmet to protect her, but revealed she has suffered being stood on by the bulls and endured knocks to the head.      Devotion: Maggie shows off her own tribute to her chosen sport - a back-tattoo of herself on a bucking bullMaggie, who says she is just as comfortable in a summer dress as she is in her Stetsons, said: ‘If I didn't wear my helmet I'd probably be a vegetable by now because I've been hit in the head.’ To keep on top of her sport, Maggie does ranch work, conducts regular workouts at the gym and practices techniques on a stationary barrel. Speaking of his protege, Maggie's trainer Gary Leffew, who has coached 12 world champions, said: ‘She wasn't very good when she came to me but she had grit. ‘That's what I admire about her. She ain't got no quit in her - she's determined and she works long and hard on it.’VIDEO Maggie wows the crowd at Bennington Rodeo
