Price of land for high-speed rail link between Birmingham and London slashed 90 per cent by the GovernmentNew figures discovered after campaigners against the line made requests under Freedom of Information By Daily Mail Reporter   Published: 17:09 BST, 2 September 2012  |  Updated: 08:26 BST, 3 September 2012    


         e-mail          41 View  comments    The cost of land to be used for development of the high-speed rail line between London and Birmingham has been dramatically reduced by the Government.Officials have cut the 'landscape value' of some of England's finest countryside by as much as 90 per cent, it was reported.The new figures were only discovered after campaigners against the 109-mile route going through the London green belt and the Chilterns - an Area of Outstanding Beauty (ANOB) - made a number of request under the Freedom of Information Act.      Protest: A sign marks the spot where a new rail bridge is proposed to be built across the countryside for the new HS2 high speed train link at the village of Middleton in Staffordshire Officials use the 'landscape impact value' to quantify in cash terms how much damage a development will do to Britain's green space and the environment.

 It is different criteria from the commercial or sale value of the land.In the official 2010 assessment of damage to the landscape, it emerged that the estimate by HS2 Ltd which is building the line, was £4.3 billion.Just under £1.1 billion was estimated for the London green belt and Chiltern ANOB.But new figures issued by the Transport Department now reveal that the route's damage would cost £978 million - down 78 per cent - and the Chiltern-London impact would be £114 million, down 90 per cent on the 2010 figure.      An artist's impression of the high-speed HS2 train which will travel between London and Birmingham  The department has made some budget cutbacks by introducing longer tunnels and roofing over  railway cuttings, but the biggest savings have been the new values placed on the countryside.They have based their figures on seven categories with urban parkland being the most valuable, followed by ANOBs and other unspoilt natural land and then green belt the third most valuable.In the new assessment, almost all the London green belt and AONB land along HS2’s proposed route has been demoted, for valuation purposes, to the lowest category of 'intensive farmland' worth just £103 per hectare.Hilary Wharf, of the HS2 Action Alliance, claimed that the move established a precedent that the 'most precious green space can be devalued whenever the Government wants to build on it badly enough.'      Beautiful landscape: The view across the Chiltern Hills towards a lion carved in the chalk hillside of Dunstable Downs  She told the Sunday Telegraph: 'We may see this happening with future big projects all over the country.'Earlier today Chancellor George Osborne signalled he wanted to speed up planning laws which would allow developers to build on the green belt as long as the green space is replaced by the local authorities.Research by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) published last week warned that green belt land around cities and towns was under threat from plans for at least 81,000 homes, as well as roads, industrial parks, mines and airport growth.There would be an expansion of Birmingham airport, proposals for freight terminals near St Albans, Luton and St Helens, an opencast coal mine at Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, and a hotel and golf course in Leatherhead, Surrey.A spokesman for the Transport Department described the HS2's 2010 estimates as 'crude' because they did not include a number of factors including extra tunnelling.The estimate was 'not comparable' to the recent more sophisticated exercise, it was reported.
