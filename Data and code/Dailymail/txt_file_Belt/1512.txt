 Unholy row: Anger at Church of England's plans to build shopping and housing development on green belt landChurch could rake in £116m if plans go aheadMP urges the church to 'practice what it preaches' By Daily Mail Reporter   Updated: 16:24 BST, 22 November 2011    


              4 View  comments   An unholy row has erupted after the Church of England was accused of 'ruthlessly' putting 'profit before communities' by snapping up green belt land which had already been earmarked for development.The church purchased 180 hectares of green belt land around the area of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, in August, and could rake in a whopping £116m if housing and business developments go ahead.The Church Commissioners confirmed they had bought the land - known as Windsor Park - from UK Coal along with four other sites for a combined total of £12.5m.      Not happy: Rod Lilley is leading a protest group against housing and business developments on land owned by the Church of England A property expert said the agricultural value of the land would have been around £2m.But the church could now net a windfall as the 86 acres put forward as a possible business site are worth around £100,000 per acre.     RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       RE teacher and mother-of-three is suspended over allegations of affair with sixth-former at her school

 The remaining 358 acres could be worth £300,000 per acre if used for residential purposes.Simon Reevell, MP for Dewsbury, urged the church to 'practice what it preaches'. He said: 'They want to "maximise the income from their investment portfolio". They say that they have to do this because it is their "legal duty".     Protesting: Action group leader Rod Lilley has accused the church of seeking to profit at the expense of locals'That would be the same "legal duty" that obliges FT100 companies to maximise profits for their shareholders but whose behaviour prompted the Archbishop of York to warn that such behaviour can "weaken community life".'Our Church leaders are perfectly entitled to argue that the worst excesses of capitalism should be curbed. 'Pursuing profit before anything else takes us back to the worst excess of a by-gone age and senior members of the clergy may well want to speak out against it.'But shouldn't they start a little closer to home? As far as the land at Chidswell is concerned, the Church Commissioners that I have referred to are in a remarkably strong position should they wish to practice what they preach.'I suspect my constituents in Chidswell will struggle to reconcile an attitude of profit before communities with the Archbishop of York's invitation to strive for a "change of ethics to the accumulation of wealth".'Rod Lilley, 51, is spearheading the Chidswell Action Group, who oppose the plans - which will be implemented if a Local Development Framework put forward by council officers is accepted by members.Now, he has accused the church of seeking to profit at the expense of locals and has revealed he is so 'disillusioned' that he has turned his back on the church he loves.Mr Lilley, managing director of a haulage company, said: 'I've been going to church for years but not now.'It's a sad moment for me. But I have to stand up for what I believe in.'Here I am year in, year out looking for money for Christian Aid, but by buying the land they are getting rid of farmers who produce barley, corn and other products, and turning it into a concrete city.  'This is the last bit of green belt land to separate Leeds, Kirklees and Dewsbury.'They are just making money for themselves. Why should I dig deep to help the third world when the church is just profiting for itself?      Similar: Vicar Amanda Barraclough said the situations in Dewsbury and outside St Paul's Cathedral resonate because society is asking questions about how we measure success'What the church really should be doing is giving money to run-down churches instead of sending us out begging for money.'I've cancelled my direct debit to the church and have no plans to return. 'We have to stop the plan before it gets the go-ahead. If the council gets what it wants, the land will be brown belt and they can develop on it.'Even Amanda Barraclough, the vicar of St Mary's Church in Woodkirk, attended a protest meeting along with over 600 other locals, insisting that there is a difference between local parishes and the church 'head office'.Reverend Barraclough, 50, said: 'I have strong sympathies with where the action group are coming from.'I hope people can see the difference between local church communities and the "head office" which is rather detached from life on the ground.'The situations in Dewsbury and outside St Paul's Cathedral resonate because our society is clearly asking big questions about how we measure success - is it an accumulation of wealth and status?'A spokesman for the Church Commissioners said: 'It is for the democratically-elected local planning authority to assess the best balance for its area of employment, housing, and other amenities.'We have been liaising with various representatives of the local community since buying this land in August. Should those responsible decide to allocate the land in the long-term for use as a business park and for housing, we would support that.'The local authority's plans, to go before the council tomorrow, state that they need 25,400 homes in Kirklees by 2028 including the Chidswell site.Jacqui Gedman, Kirklees Council's acting director of place, said: 'The use of green belt land is, as we would expect, a contentious issue. 'But, surprisingly, many people are unaware that 70 per cent of land in Kirklees falls within the green belt. 'This means that virtually all homes, offices, factories, shops, schools and parks are concentrated in the remaining 30 per cent.'This proposal requires no more than one per cent of the green belt to be released for potential future development.'John Denham, from Campaign for Rural England West Yorkshire said: 'We were very shocked by these proposals. 'We think there is sufficient brown belt land in the area so the council should not have to build on green belt land.'We will continue the fight against this development. Green belt land is precious.'
