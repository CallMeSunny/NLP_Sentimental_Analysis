Mrs Grant, 50, who entered Parliament at the 2010 General Election by winning Ann Widdecombe’s old seat, was the first black woman selected to defend a Tory seat.

 The lawyer, regarded as a fast-rising Conservative star, became a Minister in the September reshuffle when she took on the dual roles of Justice Minister and Women and Equalities Minister.The Channel 4 investigation discovered that Mrs Grant, who draws more than £26,000 a year from the solicitors’ firm she established in addition to her £97,000 pay as MP and Minister, does not have her own home in her Kent constituency.      Luxurious: Kingsworthy House, home of Tory MP Helen Grant. It is just 19 miles from Parliament        Plush: The home is worth £1.8million and is in the highly desirable market town of Reigate in Surrey Instead, she travels the 19 miles from the house she shares with her husband and two children in Surrey – bought 11 years ago for just over £1million, and now worth £800,000 more – and claims for a Thameside flat next to MI6’s headquarters.     Home number 2: Helen Grant's Thameside flat, next to MI6¿s headquarters. It costs taxpayers £20,000 a year She has charged taxpayers the maximum £1,666 a month since starting to rent the property in March.Last night, a spokesman for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which oversees MPs’ expenses, said Mrs Grant had acted within the rules on second homes.He added that it was ‘up to MPs to exercise their judgment as to how they claim their expenses’.A spokeswoman for Mrs Grant said: ‘Mrs Grant’s constituency has been deemed by IPSA to be a non-London constituency and she is therefore fully entitled to use her rental accommodation allowance either in London or in the constituency.’Earlier this month her constituency assistant Tony Williams said he was disgusted after she altered his contract to cut his sick pay when he needed time off for a heart condition.Mr Williams’s contract said he was allowed up to two weeks’ sick pay – instead of the 26 weeks he was entitled to receive.Mrs Grant claimed the sick pay was docked to give taxpayers a ‘fairer deal’, but the Commons authorities said his contract should not have been altered.MPs: Are They Still At It? will be on Channel 4 Monday at 8pm.
