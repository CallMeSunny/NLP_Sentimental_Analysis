 It syncs wirelessly to an app, which is used to input the wearer’s waistline measurement.If the waistline begins to expand, the belt warns the user via this app that they're putting on weight. BELT WITH A BUILT-IN CHARGER    The leather XOO Belt looks like a normal belt, but has a charger built into the buckle. It is held in place using magnets so it can be easily connected and disconnected.  The belt, which comes in black and brown, can be charged up like an ordinary smartphone via a USB cable and has enough power to charge an iPhone 6 from scratch or 'pretty much any device' in around three hours.The cable is concealed behind the leather part of the belt, which contains a flexible battery.  Belty automatically adjusts itself to be the perfect fit.When sitting down, the belt expands to give the wearer more breathing space, and it automatically tightens when the wearer stands up again.It does this by tracking tension on sensors fitted throughout the belt.Belty will also warn wearers if they’ve been sat still for too long, giving them a nudge to get up and walk around.The app can additionally be used to set maximum and minimum fittings, meaning it doesn’t become too tight, or too loose, when automatically adjusting.Plus, if the wearer leaves their fitness tracker at home, the belt includes an accelerometer and gyroscope to record steps and exercise levels, which also syncs with the app.It was created by Paris-based designers Bertrand Dupla and Carine Coulm.The product is still under development but Mr Dupla said he hopes to have Belty on the market by the end of the year, with prices yet to be announced.          The app can additionally be used to set maximum and minimum fittings for the belt (pictured), meaning it doesn’t become too tight, or too loose, when automatically adjusting       Plus, if the wearer leaves their fitness tracker at home, the belt includes an accelerometer and gyroscope to record steps and exercise levels.
