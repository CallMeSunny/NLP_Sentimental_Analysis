Good game, good game: Miranda recreates Bruce Forsyth's legendary pose in an interview last year    She said: ‘We are working closely with Miranda on how a modern day Gen Game would work, whilst she continues to be committed to her work as an exceptional actress. It’s an exciting process.’Her comments came after Miss Hart, 41, appeared to distance herself from the revival yesterday, tweeting: ‘Apparently it’s 100 per cent cert I am doing Gen Game. First I’ve heard of it. Mulling some ideas about it might be more accurate.’She also said that the idea 'is one of a few private brainstorms'.

 The show is fondly remembered by millions for its cheesy catchphrases and conveyor belt of less-than-thrilling prizes that always included a cuddly toy.At its peak in the late 1970s, it pulled in an astonishing 20 million viewers every Saturday evening, first with Bruce Forsyth at the helm and then Larry Grayson.Forsyth, whose best known lines included 'Didn't they do well?', 'Nice to see you, to see you, nice!', and 'Give us a twirl', then returned for a four-year stint in 1990 before Jim Davidson presented it from 1995 to 2002.        Challenge: Hart took to Twitter to let fans know the Guardian report was the 'first' she had heard about her 'confirmed' appearance on the show, before tweeting today that the idea is 'one of a few private brainstorms' Hart, the star of the BBC sitcom Miranda, has already appeared in a Comic Relief version of the show and described it as 'one of the greatest game shows ever'.The BBC1 controller, Charlotte Moore, told the Guardian: 'It will be a modern reinvention of the Generation Game.'Miranda will bring a very different flavour to it. Her wit and spirit behind it will naturally move it into the modern era. Miranda is brilliant at engaging with people, she loves that interaction. She'll be brilliant.'Hart is a huge fan of the show and sang its praises in an interview she did with Forsyth last year.She said: 'Bruce is too modest to say this but I am going to say it for him. During the 1970s the Generation Game was getting over 20 million viewers every week and my family were among them. I loved it. It is one of the greatest game shows ever.'She even defended the programme when Forsyth himself said it might now be considered 'old hat'.        Generation Game: Bruce Forsyth, right, and Anthea Redfern, centre, in action on the show. At its peak in the 1970s it pulled in 20million viewers a week  The show's format involved couples of family members competing against each other in a series of challenges.Typically the couples comprised family members who were a generation apart, such as mother and son.The new Generation Game is likely to be tweaked to make it relevant for a modern audience but insiders expect all the classic ingredients to remain the same. It is not known who will be Hart's co-host and whether the job will go to a man or a woman. One of hostesses in the original show, Anthea Redfern, famously had an affair with Forsyth and married him in 1973 before divorcing him six years later. The BBC hopes the new version will prove as popular as Strictly Comes Dancing, which pulls in more than 11 million viewers.
