         e-mail          2 View  comments    A choirboy may have accidentally strangled himself during an experiment to improve his singing by restricting his breath, an inquest heard yesterday.Judge’s son Edward Morgan-Gooch, 12, was concerned he wouldn’t be able to hit high notes when his voice broke. His mother, Julia, 43, had tucked him up in bed but found him lifeless on the floor when returned to switch off his bedside light.Her husband Christopher Morgan, 48, a barrister who sits as a Recorder at Norwich Crown Court, tried to resuscitate him.      Grief: Recorder Christopher Morgan, whose son Edward Morgan-Gooch , accidentally strangled himself to death, arrives today at the inquest held in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk The inquest heard that Edward was a ‘well-motivated’ boy who was active and happy at school and had shown no intent to harm himself.Instead he was said to be focussed on trying to do his best as a chorister at 16th century St Edmundsbury Cathedral in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.An investigation by consultant paediatrician Dr Peter Powell, of the Suffolk safeguarding children team, concluded that he might have put the belt around his neck to improve his singing.Suffolk coroner Dr Peter Dean said: ‘He was a chorister and he had raised concerns about being able to sing high notes once his voice had broken.‘It is possible that he might have been trying to assist his breathing in some way. There was nothing about his behaviour that gave any concern that anything was troubling Edward.‘His family quickly concluded that his intention was not to harm himself, but rather an experimental or exploratory act. It may have been something that was difficult for Edward to explain, but children can carry out acts which are out of character.     Judge: A professional picture of Recorder Morgan‘All who knew Edward knew he was focussed on trying to perform his best for the choir. ‘Dr Powell stated that he may have in some way been seeking to improve his breath-holding skills or his voice and it is something that tragically went wrong.‘He was enthusiastic and striving for excellence without any suggestion of being unhappy. There is no suggestion that he had any unhappiness or interest in harming himself in any way.’Dr Dean described Edward as ‘an active and enthusiastic member’ of the Cathedral choir.He had attended choir practice on the morning of November 2 last year before his classes at St James Middle School, a Church of England Voluntary Aided School in Bury St Edmunds.After school, he attended an All Souls Service at the cathedral in the evening before returning to his family home at Wickhambrook near Bury St Edmunds.Dr Dean said: ‘He seemed excited about a new piece of music and packed his school bag before he went to bed. There was no clues of anything untoward.‘Immediately before going to bed, he was preparing for future musical events The inquest in Bury St Edmunds heard that Edward’s mother Julia Gooch had ‘tucked him up in bed as normal’ and left him to read or listen to an audio book.Around 40 minutes later at 9.30pm, she went to turn off his light and found him unresponsive and sitting sideways on the floor beside his bed with the belt around his neck.Mrs Gooch, 42, a legal executive for a firm of solicitors in Newmarket, called for help and her husband managed to untie the belt and attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation.Paramedics who were alerted by a 999 call carried on trying to revive him and took him to the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds where attempts continued, but he was declared dead.Dr Dean said that a police investigation headed by Det Sgt Carl Dye of Suffolk Police found there were no suspicious circumstances.He said: ‘This was not believed in any circumstances to be a suspicious death. It was clearly an unexplained tragedy.‘All the reports indicate that Edward had been his normal self and had had earlier been at school and the choir. ‘He was found seated on the floor. It would be wrong to describe this as hanging.’Mrs Gooch wept throughout the hearing as she sat with her husband listening to Dr Dean recount the evidence.      Imposing: St Edmundsbury Cathedral where12 year old Edward Morgan-Gooch sang as a chorister A post mortem by paediatric pathologist Dr Flora Jessop at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, concluded that his death was caused by ligature compression to his neck.Dr Dean said that a safeguarding children investigation found no suggestion that Edward intended to harm himself and concluded that he had a happy and supportive life at home and schoolHe added: ‘It is clear from the evidence that he didn’t intend to harm himself and he was a happy, highly motivated and active child, fully committed to his work as a chorister.‘He used his computer for social messaging, but nothing on there showed an intent to harm himself. On the contrary, he was enjoying his choral and scholastic life and looking forward to the future.’Dr Dean said Edward’s death should serve as a warning of the ‘extreme danger’ of doing anything which involved neck compression.He said: ‘The danger of sudden death is ever present. There is no suggestion that Edward as anything but a much loved, very happy and enthusiastic young lad who was clearly highly motivated and very much enjoyed his time as a chorister and was thinking actively of the future.‘It does seem from all the evidence that this was a tragic act that went wrong, an act conducted with no intent to harm himself. I wish to emphasise the extreme dangers of any sort of experimentation involving pressure on the neck.’Dr Dean recorded a verdict of accidental death.Mr Morgan, 47, was called to the Bar as a barrister in 1987 and was made a Recorder in 2009. He has presided in recent months over several cases at Norwich Crown Court.The Very Rev Dr Frances Ward, the Dean of St Edmundsbury, described Edward at the time of his death as ‘a lovely, happy 12-year-old’ and said his death was ‘a tragic accident’.She added in a statement: ‘Edward enjoyed life immensely. We will all miss his enthusiasm and passion for singing, his cheerfulness and his lively and inquisitive personality.’Edward joined the Cathedral as a probationer in February 2009 and became a full chorister the following September. He was baptised in 2010 and had his Confirmation last year in the Cathedral.He was among a group of choristers who met Prince Charles on his official visit to the Cathedral in March last year.Paul Elstone, the headteacher of the 487-pupil St James Middle School, said: ‘The school was saddened by the shocking news of Edward’s death.‘He was a lively and cheerful pupil who had contributed much, especially to the musical life of the school. He will be sadly missed.’Mr Morgan’s entry on his Chambers website describes him as being ‘experienced in all areas of criminal law’. It adds: ‘He is regularly instructed to prosecute and defend in serious cases of violence (murder/ manslaughter); sexual offences (with emphasis on child sex abuse cases); fraud; and large -scale drug conspiracies. ‘He has particular experience prosecuting/ defending in covert surveillance cases, and is regularly asked to advise on matters concerning disclosure of sensitive material and present public interest immunity applications.’The coroner gave a verdict of accidental death.
