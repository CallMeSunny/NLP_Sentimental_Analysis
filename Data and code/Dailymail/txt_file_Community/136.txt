 Mr Johnson said: ‘It is about control. It is about security, safety of your country and your economy and being in charge.‘You want to be able to manage your household yourself, you want to be able to manage how things work pretty exactly.‘If we take back control of immigration we can help local authorities plan for vital services. That will mean that young people will have a better chance of getting on the housing ladder and there will be less pressure on school places or the NHS. At the moment the system is out of control and no one can plan effectively.’         In an exclusive Daily Mail interview, Mr Johnson said uncontrolled EU immigration was preventing the public sector from properly planning to ensure there are enough schools, GP surgeries and homesHe added: ‘It will take time – but if you have an immigration system that is based on the needs of the economy rather than just a doctrine and ideology of free movement, I think you get to plan better.‘You’re thinking about your kids and whether they are going to be able to afford a home. That is of great importance. Whether your kids can be part of an economy that is outward-looking and mobilised – able to do deals with growth economies not locked into the EU.‘I’d be thinking where is Britain going – what is it going to be like for us in 20 or 30 years’ time. Are we going to be part of this very closed system or are we going to take back control and really set our priorities?’Mr Johnson dismissed the doom-mongering of David Cameron and the Remain camp, saying: ‘I have seen no evidence of an economic shock.’ He went on: ‘The only way to end this tidal wave of gloom from the Government is to vote Leave.‘I think the negativity is very intense and I do not think it is doing anybody’s mood much good. If I were them I would not have fought the campaign this way.’At a rally in London yesterday, Mr Johnson said the way to ‘neutralise’ extremist views in Britain was for the country to regain control of its borders. He said those who ‘play politics’ with immigration would be silenced if the UK was able to take charge of a ‘completely out of control’ system.The former London mayor also repeated previous calls for an amnesty on illegal immigrants who have been here for more than 12 years.He said: ‘If we take back control of our immigration system with an Australian-style points-based system, we’ll be dealing fairly and justly with every part of the world and we will be neutralising people in this country and across Europe who wish to play politics with immigration and who are opposed to immigrants. That is the way forward.’         He asked Leave supporters to imagine waking up on Friday morning to face the ‘terrible sense of shock and disappointment that Remain have narrowly won’.Mr Johnson said the TV cameras would turn to ‘[European Commission president] Jean-Claude Juncker celebrating with what looks suspiciously like champagne, and then go to Peter Mandelson and the rest saying the way is now clear for Britain to join the euro’.He added: ‘We will have missed a fantastic opportunity for change and improvement for Europe and this country ... We cannot vote for a status quo, with the EU morphing relentlessly into a superstate, with activist judges making decisions including who can be on our streets whether they are terror suspects and convicted criminals or not.’Attacking the Remain side, he added: ‘They endlessly say we can’t do it, we daren’t do it, we mustn’t do it – and we say that we can.’'Ignore Obama's threats'A group of powerful US Congressmen yesterday said Britain will be at the ‘front’ of the line for a trade deal in the event of Brexit.The 11 politicians demolish a central plank of the case that Britain will not be able to trade freely with the world outside the EU.In a letter to President Obama, they also attack him for his ‘misguided effort’ to try to bully Britain into a vote to remain.         In a letter to President Obama, pictured, a group of powerful Congressmen have attacked him for his ‘misguided effort’ to try to bully Britain into a vote to remainIn April, Mr Obama made the extraordinary threat that we would be at the ‘back of the queue’ for a trade deal – even though his presidency is nearly over.The signatories to the letter include Devin Nunes and Pat Tiberi, two former chairmen of Congress’s Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.Their letter states that while a Brexit vote ‘may open new opportunities for cooperation with our British friends’, it ‘will not diminish any of our vital ties’ . It adds: ‘For us, Britain stands at the front of the line.’Polls say it's too close to callThe EU referendum looked too close to call last night as two polls showed a late swing back to the Remain camp.The polls based on the latest surveys of voters – which were conducted almost entirely after the killing on Thursday of Labour MP Jo Cox – both put the In side in the lead.It reverses a rise in support for Leave, with seven out of nine surveys released before the murder putting the pro-Brexit camp ahead.A Survation telephone poll for The Mail on Sunday, conducted on Friday and Saturday, put Remain on 45 per cent, with Leave on 42 per cent. Survation’s previous poll, published on Thursday, had shown Out ahead of In by the same margin. A YouGov online poll for The Sunday Times, conducted on Thursday and Friday, showed a 44-43 per cent lead for In. It reversed a lead of seven points for Out in a YouGov survey last Monday.But an online poll by Opinium for The Observer showed Leave drawing level with Remain on 44 per cent each. Interviews took place between Tuesday and Friday. An Opinium/Observer poll, published on June 11, showed In ahead of Out by 44-42 per cent. BREXIT BITES: A ROUND-UP OF OTHER NEWS IN COUNTDOWN TO EU VOTE  Cameron 'misled MPs and voters over his EU deal'          David Cameron alongside David Dimbleby during a BBC Question Time event in Milton Keynes last nightDavid Cameron has been accused of misleading MPs and the public after claiming he had ‘secured vital treaty changes’ in his negotiations with the European Union.The Prime Minister made the claim in the Commons this month despite the fact that his ‘deal’ has not involved any changes to EU treaties.Veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash demanded he withdraw the claim, saying that under Commons rules, ministers must resign if they mislead MPs.Sir Bill said: ‘Voters are being told we secured “vital treaty changes”, but when they cast their vote [in the referendum] there is no guarantee whatsoever that any such treaty changes will happen.’In a letter to the Mr Cameron, he wrote: ‘I do not know whether this was inadvertent or not, but either way it requires correction. To do otherwise would be to mislead the Commons and the country.’The House of Commons Library found Mr Cameron’s deal was ‘not a binding EU treaty or EU law’. And the European Scrutiny Committee, chaired by Sir Bill, found the deal ‘does not and cannot change the [EU] treaty’.However, Mr Cameron told Sir Bill his deal includes a ‘binding and irreversible commitment that the EU member states will at the next opportunity amend the EU treaties to address key UK concerns’.Bosses attack EU 'straitjacket'Britain must quit the ‘energy-sapping’ EU and free firms from Brussels control, a group of entrepreneurs said last night.The 37 small business owners said their companies would thrive once freed from the EU ‘straitjacket’.The signatories to the letter are led by Luke Johnson, who has made Pizza Express and Patisserie Valerie into nationwide successes.All 37 entrepreneurs have become major market players after turning an original idea or a small family firm into top wealth-creators.In the letter to the Sun on Sunday, they say: ‘This was achieved in spite of the EU, not because of it.’Lined up with Mr Johnson for Brexit are Superdrug founder Peter Goldstein, Toby Baxendale of Direct Seafoods and James Tanner of Tanners Wine.John Mills of retail promotions firm JML and Stuart Wheeler of finance company IG have also thrown their weight behind him.Brexiter, 80, held over 'Out' graffitiAn 80-year-old Brexit campaigner revealed yesterday that he had been arrested after being caught painting ‘Vote Leave’ in 2ft-high letters around his home town.Veteran former councillor John Kapp said he had been arrested for the first time in his life after police caught him daubing the ‘Out’ message in white paint on eight billboards by the side of a road.Officers who arrested him on suspicion of causing criminal damage have released him on bail while they investigate his actions, on condition that he does not leave home carrying a brush or pot of paint.The lifelong Conservative supporter, from Hove, East Sussex, said: ‘I’ve had a Vote Leave sticker in my window for weeks now but hardly anyone goes down the road where I live, so I thought I’d choose the A259 where lots of people will see it.’ He went on to say he was ‘disgusted’ by tactics used by the Remain campaign.
