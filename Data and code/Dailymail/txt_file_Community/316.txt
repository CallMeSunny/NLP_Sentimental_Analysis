 According to Robertson, the publishers were concern that Christian retailers wouldn’t buy the book because of his public advocacy for gay and lesbian inclusion in Christian communities. Destiny Image had previously agreed to publish the book last year, with no advance payment, after Robertson submitted a proposal while still a student at the conservative Moody Bible Institute in Chicago.The book, described as a collection of essays on his personal spiritual journey from a fundamentalist to a progressive evangelical, makes only a glancing reference to homosexuality         Robertson, who is also a spokesperson for Evangelicals for Marriage Equality, refused to sign the statement that he does 'not condone, encourage, or accept the homosexual lifestyle'Don Nori of parent company Nori Media Group told TIME: 'We did not reject or refuse. As with all books, a publisher decides what is financially viable.'We released the book back to the author with our sincere prayers for his success. This occurrence happens every season.'According to Robertson the incident illustrates a much larger problem that the evangelical community has with homosexuality.'This is so symptomatic of what happens in the broader evangelical community—every day, LGBTQ individuals are told that they are no longer welcome in churches, are kicked out of homes, are fired from jobs, and forced in to reparative therapy by those who claim to represent Jesus.'
