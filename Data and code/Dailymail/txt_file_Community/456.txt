Munster's European Champions Cup destiny is slipping out of their hands after they were beaten 26-19 by star-studded Clermont Auvergne at Stade Marcel-Michelin.Munster had never lost the back-to-back contests of rounds three and four but Clermont became the first to do that double over the former champions following their historic 16-9 win at Thomond Park a week earlier.It means Clermont are firm automatic quarter-final qualifiers after they moved four-points clear at the top of a hugely competitive Pool 1 having collected 17 points ahead of Saracens, with Munster third on 10 points - the Irish team facing Saracens and Sale Sharks next month.
