Because no hot boys love her. #realisticYA.'  Other tweets look at young teens in a realistic manner, calling them '100% human' rather than 'mysterious and broody', and others look at realistic situations that arise with teen romances.Another tweet describes being too busy to be the 'chosen one' - referring to the character Beatrice Prior in Divergent.Preeti Chhibber writes: 'Girl is Chosen One but actually has 250hrs of community service, college apps, SATs and resume building so she can't but thx #realisticYA.'                 Not the chosen one?

He's smart, cute & interested. She has a panic attack and hides in the bathroom.'
