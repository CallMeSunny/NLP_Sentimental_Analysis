 Dennis may just be the perfect match for millionaire former real estate developer turned felon Ravenel, even with the 30-year age gap.Like Dennis, Ravenel also has a history of booze-fueled lawbreaking.                                            Fertile for ground for drama: Dennis and Ravenel have a knack for having fun both separately and together. One recent episode of high reality show drama showed the couple in a doctor's office as they anxiously awaited Dennis' pregnancy test results, which ultimately came back negative         Not the father: Another Southern Hospitality cast member, self-proclaimed rascally raconteur Shep Rose was also worried he was the father of Dennis' baby, but she wasn't actually pregnant at the time          Like gentlemen: In an encounter unrelated to the pregnancy, Ravenel invited fellow cast member Whitney Sudler-Smith to 'take it outside,' where he accused the show's resident southern dandy of sleeping with Dennis  He pleaded guilty just last March to driving drunk while summering in East Hampton, New York last July.The former Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign chairman had his license suspended for six months and was fined $1,400, according to the Post and Courier.While clearly a lot of fun while apart, Ravenel and Dennis know how to have a good time while together, as well.        Earlier times: Kathryn (right) caused a stir when she first made an appearance on the show as a minor character, and proceeded to turn Thomas' (right) life upside down            Talking trash: The pair drew snickers and sideways glances upon their arrival at a friend's party  A recent episode of their southern-gentry-on-the-rocks docuseries showcased Dennis' pregnancy scare, though it remained unclear if it was Ravenel who was the potential father or fellow star and self-proclaimed rascally raconteur Shep Rose.Lucky for everyone, except perhaps the show's avid viewers, Dennis did not end up being pregnant.Meanwhile, and despite not actually being a main cast member, Dennis' presence on the show is fertile ground for cultivating the canniest of drama, intrigue and southern seduction.YA'LL LOOKIN' FOR A GOOD TIME? LOOK NO FURTHER THAN SOUTHERN CHARM'S THOMAS AND KATHRYNTHOMAS RAVENEL: THE ONCE AND FUTURE SOUTH CAROLINA POLITICAL POWER PLAYER?       Thomas Ravenel  Ravenel, who's 48 according to his BravoTV bio but 51 if you prefer to believe news outlets such as the Associated Press, was once a major up-and-coming force in Palmetto State politics.The millionaire former real estate developer held the state-wide elected office of South Carolina Treasurer and had served as chairman for Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign in the state before he was brought down hard in a cocaine scandal.Ravenel was indicted on federal drug charges in 2007 for buying less than 500 grams of cocaine to share with other people in late 2005. He was sentenced in 2008 to 10 months after his felony conviction.And what about now? Besides the Bravo gig, or perhaps because of it, Ravenel is reportedly eying a dive back into politics.The Republican ex-con told Andy Cohen early this month that he likely intends to run for U.S. Senate.'And should the current U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham be the nominee, I’m going to throw my hat into the ring as a candidate because I think the voters need the opportunity to have a choice,' he said on Watch What Happens Live.       Kathryn Dennis  KATHRYN CALHOUN DENNIS: POLITICAL SCION, MODEL, CELEBUTANTE, SEDUCTRESSKathryn Dennis raised the eyebrows of Charleston, South Carolina's garden-partying elite when she dropped onto the scene as Ravenel's girlfriend, but it's not her first lap around the disgraced politician dating pool.The 22-year-old was once involved with Thad Viers, a former state representative who resigned his office in disgrace in 2012 after he was arrested for harassing an ex-girlfriend.Her politico predilections may stem from her background as the daughter of two prominent political families.Dennis' grandfather was celebrated state politician Rembert C. Dennis and she claims to be a descendant of America's seventh vice president John C. Calhoun (hence the middle name).
