 On Tuesday, the foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei was asked whether Xi is in good health, but only said he had no information to give, and declined to answer further questions on the matter.The lack of official explanation has fuelled Internet speculation surrounding Xi's condition.      Absent: Speculation about the future Chinese leader's whereabouts were rife after Xi cancelled his meeting with Hilary Clinton China's popular Twitter-like microblogging site Sina Weibo blocked searches for Xi's name, as is common with top leaders, but users as usual found ways to skirt the restrictions, referring to Xi as 'the crown prince'.‘What's up with the crown prince? He's vanished for the last 10 days or so and the whole world is wondering where he is,’ wrote one user.Xi had been scheduled to meet visiting Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt on Monday afternoon for a photo opportunity, but the event did not take place.However, Thorning-Schmidt said that a meeting with Xi had never been on her schedule for her visit.‘I think there has been a slight misunderstanding,’ she told Reuters. ‘I would, of course, very much like to see him [Xi] and I think I will see him at some stage, perhaps on my next visit to China, but he was never in my programme which we released on Friday, so there shouldn't be anything new in my not seeing him.’                Prime time miss: Danish PM Helle Thoring-Schmidt and Singapore's Lee Hsien Loong were both originally scheduled to meet with Xi Jinping during their visits The foreign ministry's website shows Xi's most recent public appearance was at a ceremony at the ruling Communist Party's Central Party School in Beijing on September 1.The rumours about Xi come at a tempestuous time for Chinese politics.

The wife, Gu Kailai, was given a suspended death sentence last month.In another scandal this month, a senior ally of President Hu Jintao was demoted after sources said the ally's son was involved in a deadly crash involving a luxury sports car.Last year, the official Xinhua news agency was forced to come out with a one-line statement in English denying former President Jiang Zemin had died, following feverish online speculation and a report from a Hong Kong television station.
