 The trucker sobbed yesterday as an inquest heard how his lorry-load of Tarmac went over Mr Reed’s people carrier, through a hedge, up a bank, and on to the golf course near Seaham, County Durham, while he was unconscious at the wheel.Mr Davis told the inquest in Crook: ‘I was coughing. I tried to get a breath in. I started to panic. There’s no lay-by, I’m going to have to park in the road and the next thing I remember is peace and quiet.’Mr Davis, who is married with two sons, said he remembered in detail the moments leading up to the crash on the 40mph road, adding: ‘I had the radio on, I was listening to Aha’s Take On Me and I was tapping my finger. My speed was increasing. On the clock I saw I was doing 46 and I slowed down to 43.’It was then he began to cough for about six seconds before he passed out.

In a rare condition known as cough syncope, coughing can lower blood pressure, leading to unconsciousness.Mr Reed, Destiny and her mother would have died almost instantly, Durham coroner Andrew Tweddle was told.Mrs Reed, from Houghton-le-Spring, died later in hospital from multiple injuries.A driver following the lorry said it appeared Mr Davis had suffered a heart attack because he did not slow down for a bend immediately before the crash.After the crash, an off-duty police officer who had been playing golf asked Mr Davis if he knew what he had hit. The trucker replied: ‘My chin.’Paramedic Angela Leybourn  said that when the officer told him he had collided with a car: ‘His eyes shot open and it was as if he was in shock and he said, “Is the driver all right?”’Mr Tweddle returned four verdicts of accidental death.After the hearing, Julie Duggan, whose son Sean was Natalie’s partner and Destiny’s father, said: ‘I don’t know how he can live with himself.’        Accident: Robert Reed, 75, his wife Margaret, 74, their one-year-old great-granddaughter Destiny and her mother Natalie, 18, died in the collision between the Renault Scenic he was driving and a Volvo lorry      Accident: Mr Davis could remember in detail the moments leading up to the crash, which happened when he was on his way to lunch            Wreckage: The lorry went over Mr Reed's people carrier, through a hedge, up a bank, and ended up 100m away on a golf course, the inquest heard        Quick death: Mr Reed, his great-granddaughter Destiny and the baby's mother (pictured) would have died almost instantly, the coroner was told
