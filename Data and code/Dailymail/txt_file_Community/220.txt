Hull KR caretaker coach Chris Chester claims his team's Super League play-off hopes will be on the line when they host reigning champions Wigan on Thursday night.A 28-10 defeat at Widnes in their last match left Rovers three points behind the eighth-placed Vikings, but a win over the Warriors, who have the chance to go top of the table, would keep the campaign alive for Chester's men with three matches left of the regular season.Chester, whose own position would be strengthened with a third win under his temporary charge, is hoping for a response after accusing his players of 'dishonesty' in their last outing.

   'We've done a bit of soul-searching and had a few heart-to-hearts,' Chester said. 'We were dishonest against Widnes and we have addressed that in training over the past two weeks.'Hopefully we'll get some kind of reaction with a much more professional performance against Wigan.'We still believe. There are still eight points up for grabs and we have to make sure we put a good display in on Thursday and get a result. If we don't get a performance, it probably throws away our chances of making the play-offs.'It's a tough ask but I watched the Bradford game in depth and they showed it can be done. They got in their faces early and we have to make sure we have a good start and stay with them.'         Return: Blake Green will make his comeback from injury after a three-month layoff against old club Hull KRWigan's shock 16-8 defeat by Bradford last month means they have lost on five of their six trips into Yorkshire this year, but they won at Hull FC in May and inflicted on Rovers a club record 84-6 humiliation in the corresponding match in 2013.The Warriors had to work for their win over Hull KR at the DW Stadium in March and coach Shaun Wane is determined not to under-estimate his team's opponents.'Hull KR is a tough place to go,' Wane said. 'It is an old-style ground and they are a good team.'They are well coached by Chris Chester who I know well. He will have them very motivated as they want to get into the top eight and ensure their season does not end after four games.'We got our fingers burnt at Bradford and Wakefield so I am sure we will go there with a good attitude and our players understand that the games left are all like Grand Finals.'         Return: Green (right), who played stand-off for Hull KR between 2011 and 2012, has had a bicep injury since MayThe 2013 double winners, who have already relinquished their hold on the Challenge Cup, are two points behind St Helens but have a superior points difference so would leapfrog their arch rivals, at least for 24 hours, with a win at the KC Lightstream Stadium.'We want to win the League Leaders' Shield so we have four Grand Finals left, which if we win, then puts the pressure all on St Helens,' Wane added.Wigan's former Hull KR stand-off Blake Green will make his comeback from a three-month lay-off, caused by a ruptured bicep, and Wane is also able to call on forward Eddy Pettybourne, who has been out for a month with a jaw injury.Hull KR have forward Rhys Lovegrove back from injury while utility back Craig Hall is set to take over at centre from the axed Kris Welham, who was sent to partner club Gateshead last weekend in an attempt to re-discover his lost confidence.
