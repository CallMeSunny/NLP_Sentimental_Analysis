 'My choice; to be a size 0 or a size 15. They don’t have a size for my spirit, and never will,'To use cotton and silk to trap my soul is to believe that you can halt the expansion of the universe.'Since it was published at the weekend, the video, which was produced by filmmaker Homi Adajania, has been viewed more than two million times.           Deepika at the Cannes film festival in 2010 While many responses to the clip have been positive, there has also been a significant backlash.Many of its critics have taken issue with one of the parts of the speech where Deepika talks about sex outside of marriage. She says: 'My choice to marry, or not to marry,'To have sex before marriage, to have sex out of marriage, or to not have sex,My choice to love temporarily, or to lust forever.' Twitter user ‏@roopabanerjee wrote: 'The main error in Deepika Padukone's #VogueEmpower video: a world where #MyChoice rules would be a sad and dangerous place to live in.'Another called @Amaa_Yaar wrote: 'The speed of universe's expansion is directly proportionate to a woman sleeping outside her marriage! '                           Twitter reactions to the My Choice video Others have taken issue with who the message is directed at, claiming that the women who would really benefit from it are India's poorest, but that it is being shared among the those who are already empowered - the middle classes. DNA India writer Soumonty Kanungo wrote in a blog post: 'When it says "My Body, My Mind, My Choice", what is the video really trying to convey? Whose choice? Urban women? Educated urban women? Educated, working urban women? Is there any choice for those unexposed to this video? No!'There are thousands of women in lanes and by-lanes of cities and villages of India who don't have a choice. Choice is too fancy a word for them. They just take orders and obey.'They take orders in every step of their lives as their choices are not for themselves alone, but for their families as well. 'Are they wrong in thinking beyond themselves? Are they wrong, if they chose to compromise to make room for those they love? These are far more real choices, much more significant than clothes and sex.'
