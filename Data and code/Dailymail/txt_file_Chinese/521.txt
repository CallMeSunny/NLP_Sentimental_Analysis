A man in China who owns a zoo in China has been forced to admit that he feeds dead animals from the zoo to the other inhabitants because he can't 'waste good meat'. Tan Decai owns the zoo, sells tickets cleans and acts as a tour guide at Wanzhou Park in southwest China's Chongqing, reports the People's Daily Online. The park has been criticised by internet users online who say the conditions in the park are poor however others have come out in support for the man who admits that he struggles to feed the inhabitants.          Trying as hard as possible: Tan does everything at the zoo from feeding to selling tickets and also caring for the animals          Tragic: A monkey is locked in a cage at Wangzhou Zoo in Chongqing China where admission costs just 10 yuan (£1.16)         It's all good meat: One of his ostriches was mauled to death by a wolf and Tan decided to feed its remains to the lioness    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Fury at Univision's plans to broadcast a detailed...

Entrance to the zoo costs 10 yuan (£1.16). However he couldn't stop his ostrich being mauled to death by a jackal after it got too close to the animal's enclosure. Tang told reporters that he will feed parts of the ostrich to his lion as 'there is no point wasting good meat'. Images show the animals kept in cramped conditions needed serious care and attention. While one photo appears to show the owner taunting a lioness that is said to be some 20 years old so that reporters and tourists could get a better picture.  The lioness is said to be in an enclosure that is just 200 square feet. According to Tan, at the time of the journalist's visit, the monkey was put in closed confinement for being too naughty.           Tragic: A monkey is carried in its small cage by Tan who does everything from running the park to caring for the animals         Upsetting: A white fox is kept in a tiny cage at the park alongside 20 other animals including a lion and a black bear         A peacock at the zoo: 56-year-old Tan says he lives off any money made from ticket admission and has a simple life         The lion is fed chicken as that is the most that Tan can afford whereas the chickens are fed vegetable scrapsThe 56-year-old left his rural home in Sichuan province 20 years ago. He says his wife works away from home and their children are married with their own children some six or seven years old. They asked him not to come home for Chinese New Year. He told reporters: 'I have no concept of family, I have been here so many years.' Tan has hired a man to help him clean the cages and pays him 2,000 yuan (£232) a month. However he has since had surgery and is recovering at home. It's unclear if he will return. He says that money for feeding the animals comes from ticket revenue and if there is a surplus then that is his profit. Tan's average daily income is 200 yuan (£23) however after running costs he is left with just 4,000 yuan a month (£464) to feed the animals.           Lioness: Tan runs the zoo alone and is cut off from his family who asked him not to return home for Chinese New Year         Struggle: The 56-year-old has struggled to care for the animals in the zoo and lives off money made from entrance tickets         A cheap day out in China: Tan Decai carries a small cage with a monkey in it at Wangzhou zoo Because of his shortage of funds he mainly buys chicken for the lion and black bear while the monkeys are fed corn and rice. The chickens are fed discarded leaves from the vegetable market. He has since been slammed by internet users on news163.com. One user commented: 'Compared to the animals inside, the person outside is the beast.' While another asked: 'Why is it not banned?'And one user said: 'This demonstrates the pure evil of human nature.' However on Weibo, people have come out in defence of Tan. One user wrote: 'He is almost 60 years old. He has done his best to give animals a life before it got worse.' While another commented: 'Cursing will not help this man. He should be given help for these animals and help for him.' Elisa Allen, Director of PETA UK told MailOnline: 'Even under the best circumstances, no zoo can ever replicate the natural environment or social structures that wild animals need in order to have any semblance of a meaningful life, and it's hard to imagine that one man could address the needs – from veterinary to behavioural – of various species. 'From animals' perspective, zoos – whether a one-man band or a facility with a full staff – are prisons in which they're denied everything that's natural and important to them and where they must spend every single day as living exhibits. People who buy tickets to see animals locked up in cages are paying to prolong their misery.'Since the story emerged online, PETA Asia have got in contact with the owner of the zoo and are offering to help him put the animals into a sanctuary.
