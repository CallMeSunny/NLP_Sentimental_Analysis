 Taiwan's top policymaker for China affairs on Wednesday urged Beijing to resume dialogue with Taipei, after official communication channels were halted by Beijing from June.'I want to emphasise our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,' said Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, during a news briefing in response to reporters' questions on the Liaoning's movements.'On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties,' she said.China has said the Liaoning aircraft carrier was on drills to test weapons and equipment in the disputed South China Sea and its movements comply with international law.         The Liaoning, China's only aircraft carrier, is pictured sailing during military drills in the Pacific.

Neighbours Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims.After Tsai put in a congratulatory phone call to Trump, he then riled China by casting doubt on the 'one China' policy that Beijing regards as the basis of U.S.-Chinese relations.Tsai drew anger from China again when she met senior U.S. Republican lawmakers in Houston on Sunday en route to Central America, in a controversial transit stop that Beijing had asked the United States to not allow.Beijing suspects Tsai wants to push for the island's formal independence, a red line for the mainland, which has never renounced the use of force to bring what it deems a renegade province under its control.Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China.
