 A generous taxi driver has become an overnight celebrity in China after he found a huge bundle of cash in the back of his cab - and promptly returned it to its rightful owner. Zhao Lei discovered 170,000 yuan (£16,200) in a paper bag on the back seat of his taxi after taking a young couple to a car dealership in Harbin, in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang. Instead of keeping the huge haul - likely to be at least three times his annual salary - he handed it in to the company which he works for.

The delighted couple tried to offer Mr Zhao 10,000 yuan as a reward for his honesty, but he refused to accept the cash.

 'It's what I have to do,' the driver said after news of his exploits came to light. 'Anyone who lost such a big amount of money will go crazy. I won't take advantage of that.'          Pleased: The rightful owner of the money pictured after it was returned to him         Couple: The man and his girlfriend were planning to use the cash to buy a new carGDP per person in China is around £4,500, meaning that the bounty discovered by Mr Zhao represents an enormous reward for the average Chinese person. Taxi drivers earn less than 5,000 yuan a month for working punishing 14-hour shifts, six days a week. The story of Mr Zhao's selflessness is likely to be held up as an example of community spirit by the Chinese media, in contrast to a wave of stories demonstrating the increasing individualism of the country's society. In 2011, a little girl who was run over by two cars was seen on camera bleeding to death while nearly 20 passers-by simply ignored her plight. President Xi Jinping has introduced the concept of the 'Chinese Dream' in a bid to ensure that citizens retain their sense of social solidarity as the country grows wealthier and more westernised.
