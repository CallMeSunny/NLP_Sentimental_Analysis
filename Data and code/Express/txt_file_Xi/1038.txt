    Will the EU make a trade deal with Britain? Will the UK remain in the single market?Brexit minister David Davis said that it was “very improbable” that the UK would remain in the EU single market while imposing new border controls, which would necessitate dozens of new agreements with nations.Mrs May is yet to announce her position on the single market, saying that Mr Davis’s statement was just “his view”. A spokeswoman said that the PM is keeping an “open mind” about Brexit negotiations, and plans to be “ambitious” in her stance.When pressed on the matter during PMQs, Mrs May said: “Our new relationship will include control of the free movement of people from the European Union into the UK. And that will include the right deal for trade in goods and services, that is how to approach it."Freedom of movement across EU states is a condition of the single market, although members of the European Economic Area are able to place some restrictions on migration.
