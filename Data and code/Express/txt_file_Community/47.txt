  DIMITRIS LEGAKIS/ ATHENA PICTURES/ EXPRESS/ TIM CLARKEBy leaving the EU we can have a fairer agricultural policy, says Jacob AnthonyJacob Anthony is a 23-year-old, 5th generation livestock farmer from Bridgend, South WalesAs a Welsh livestock farmer many of you may have been led to believe that my peers and I would be adamantly in favour of remaining in the EU. However, this is simply not the case. The Remain campaign portray farmers as the biggest potential losers from Brexit because of the subsidies that we receive through the Common Agricultural Policy.What many apparently fail to understand is that these subsidies originate as UK money that is paid to Brussels then returned to us bound in an abundance of regulation and red tape. The CAP makes every aspect of my farming life very difficult and it is only getting worse with each reform.Related articles   The Great British public will be the real losers of the EU referendum Currently we have the same rules to fit all nations which makes no sense when you have people farming reindeer at -40C in the Arctic Circle, olive growers in the Mediterranean at +40C and everything else in between – it just can’t work. By leaving the EU we can have a fairer agricultural policy that will suit our own industry and we will no longer be subsidising our competitors as net contributors to the CAP.The current payment scheme from Brussels is rewarding inefficiency which is contributing to the lack of opportunities for new entrants into the agricultural sector. For the longterm future of our industry we must vote to leave the EU.Harsimrat Kaur is a 24-year-old marketing specialist from Bradford  PHWe need to have a fair immigration policy, says Harsimrat KaurWhen I graduated and went into jobsearch mode the thing that astonished me was that there was always the question “do you have a UK or EU passport?” Candidates from EU countries get preferential treatment as they can come to Britain without visas or any application process while people from non-EU countries like India, Australia, China and Canada don’t.They have to apply for a visa and get sponsorship before being allowed here – and there is no guarantee they can stay. My grandfather came to the UK in 1963 from India. Britain gave him the chance to earn a fair day’s wage for a fair day’s work. It became his home, allowing him to run his own business and give back to a society that he was proud to be part of.Being a part of the EU allows EU citizens to have the right to come here – not based on skills, education, or what they can contribute to society – but based on where they were born. We need to have a fair immigration policy that levels the playing field for everyone. Next week we can leave the EU and join the world.

    Georgie Krone, 45, is a mother of three from WinchesterI have heard numerous people say that they will be voting for their children or grandchildren on June 23. So as a stay-at-home mother of three, how will I be voting? Well, I voted to leave by postal vote. But do not underestimate this decision. It was almost with sadness that I cast my vote as it is a sign of the failure of the EU to carry ordinary people such as myself with them on their vision for the future.I fully understand and respect some of the arguments for remaining in the EU but on balance, I believe that Britain can better thrive and provide more opportunities for the next generation if we are not part of a close political union and a restrictive and highly regulated single market.  GETTYThe European Union is a centralised and controlling power, says Georgie KroneI would like my children to have the opportunity to join businesses or to set up their own business that will prosper due to the lower regulations and the increased trading opportunities. The European Union is a centralised and controlling power, in which it attempts to impose a uniform set of rules for all 28 members so that there is a level playing field.This is a good thing for some people but it is not a good thing when trying to create jobs and grow a business. We have seen how many countries in the eurozone are facing dire youth unemployment, which is devastating for an entire generation.I do not want this future for my children so by voting to leave the EU I believe I am giving them an opportunity to make their way in the world, just as the UK will be doing if we vote to leave. Michael Reid, 52, has been a fisherman for more than 30 years and runs the family-owned boat ‘APOLLO ’ INS 179 from the small coastal village of Avoch, near Inverness, in the north-east of ScotlandWhen Edward Heath surrendered our fishing rights for membership of the EU more than 40 years ago, he said that the British fishing fleet was “expendable”. The result of EU membership allowed foreign vessels from France, Spain and others to fish in our waters under the guise of the Common Fisheries Policy.These member states were given a large share of the UK fi sh quota to allow them to fish around our coast. And as a result much of the UK fleet was subsequently decommissioned to accommodate these foreign vessels. We have not only seen the demise of the once proud British fleet but also the coastal communities that support them.  PHA vote for Brexit would have a huge impact for the fishing industry, says Michael ReidTowns and villages that were at one time home to many vessels no longer have any fishing boats. Being a skipper of a Scottish fishing vessel we have struggled to get by on the quotas handed out annually by Brussels which force us to dump large quantities of fish. How appalling it is to be throwing away prime fish, dead, back into the sea while watching our foreign neighbours fill their boats.Already this year we have seen the premature closure of the West of Scotland monkfish fishery to most Scottish vessels. The result being any monkfish caught in these waters must now be dumped dead back into the sea. A vote for Brexit would have a huge impact for the fishing industry.Not only would we regain control of our own waters but also the UK fish quota allocation. This in turn would almost definitely see a regeneration of fishing vessels and allow the coastal communities to flourish. Young blood, which the industry so desperately needs, would be attracted to a more prosperous industry.Darren Grimes, 22, is a fashion with business studies student at Brighton UniversityMy generation has been dubbed the “most entrepreneurial generation”, thanks to our overwhelming desire to start our own business, be self-employed or own our own company. I believe our generation of creatives and tech savvy movers and shakers are best placed to put to use their entrepreneurial spirit and ambition outside of the European Union.We should be outside a protectionist and unreformable fortress Europe which seeks to regulate the on-demand Uber, tax and force quotas upon streaming service Netflix, or asphyxiate the fastgrowing and potentially life-saving e-cigarette market.  EXPRESS/ TIM CLARKEWe should be outside a protectionist and unreformable fortress Europe, says Darren GrimesIt is these kinds of great market disrupters, for which the EU holds such disdain , that our generation could design more of and massively boost our GDP. Outside of the EU we could unravel ourselves from red tape which costs our businesses to the tune of £600million every single week.We could look to the growth economies of the world such as China and India who will dominate the 21st century, signing new trade deals which would bring hundreds of thousands of new jobs to our shores. This is something we’re unable to do from inside the EU, after giving up our power to speak for ourselves when it comes to trade.I’m voting to leave to look forward to a brighter future in a liberal, prosperous, free-trading, open and global Britain.

    Ann Willans is a 78-year-old pensioner from UttoxeterThere are two paramount reasons why I want Britain to leave the EU. First and foremost I am alarmed at the speed of change of the EU and the enormous impact it has on the “older” EU countries like the UK.While I understand the importance of deepening and strengthening democracy by bringing less well-off and historically less democratic countries into the fold, I feel tremendous concern at the effect this has had and will continue to have on our country. My particular concern today is the prospect of yet more countries joining the EU (Serbia, Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey) and the inevitable influx this will bring to the UK.  PETER CORNSI have no confidence in the European Union as an institution, says Ann Willans I have lost faith in the politicians who say that this is a good thing for our country. They do not understand how such large numbers arriving in quick succession affect whole communities. I also do not believe that Turkey will never join. It may not happen in my lifetime but the discussions have commenced so there is no turning back.Turkey is culturally and religiously very different to the bulk of current EU nations and while the UK is exemplary at celebrating diversity, we can only do this in situations that we can control. My second reason for voting to leave is because I have no confidence in the European Union as an institution. It is too large, too bureaucratic and too unaccountable.This is one of the reasons that so many people across the EU feel no attachment to it. We feel powerless to influence the way it operates. Instead we feel – rightly or wrongly – that it tells us what to do rather than it receiving a mandate from the people. With that unaccountability comes mistrust.Ordinary people such as myself feel that it is run by over paid bureaucrats who have a job for life and enjoy salaries that few of us, least of all UK public servants, could ever expect. Added to which we have no way of removing many of them.Related articles   Michael Gove dismisses George Osborne's doom-mongering Brexit Budget  UKIP advertising campaign sends a message that we are better OUT  Outrage at ‘thickies will back Brexit’ jibe by Labour councillor
