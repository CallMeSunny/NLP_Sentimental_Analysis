With President Xi leading us, China will be more prosperous and more powerful,' said Zhang Rihong, one of the 3,000 delegates to the National People's Congress in Beijing.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Chinese told they must swap chopsticks for knives and forks...    Share this articleShare Though Xi, 59, is now formally in charge, big challenges remain for him within the party's top ranks - in which powerful people are often divided by patronage, ideology or financial interests.He has pledged to tackle the endemic graft which he says is detrimental to the party's survival, according to Willy Lam, a China politics watcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.       New president: Xi Jinping, right, has taken over as China's top leader from Hu Jintao, left      Take a bow: The new president acknowledges delegates to the congress after his election     Handover: Xi is taking power at a crucial period for the global superpower      New boss: Xi walks to the stage to cast his vote in the presidential election which he wonXI JINPING, THE 'LEADER OF THE UNFREE WORLD'Xi Jinping, the most powerful man in China, is a 59-year-old Communist Party loyalist and son of a famous revolutionary leader.He was born in 1953 to Xi Zhongxun, a political leader who helped overthrow China's government in 1949 and later held a number of senior positions.Xi grew up in Beijing and studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University, joining the Communist Party at the age of 21.As is customary, he spent many years as a party official in various provincial areas - but also visited a small town in Iowa to research American agriculture.Xi's big breakthrough came in 2000 when he was appointed governor of Fujian province, subsequently becoming party chief in Zhejiang and then Shanghai.In 2007 he was appointed to the all-powerful Standing Committee of the Politburo, and became vice-president the next year, putting him first in line to take the top job during the handover of power to the next generation which took place last November.  Graft is deeply ingrained in the party's patronage-based culture and those at the top - many of whose families have benefited from their political connections - are believed to be most resistant to anti-corruption measures that diminish their prerogatives.'He has to walk a fine line,' Lam said. 'If he were really serious about going after senior cadres, he might establish his authority within the rank and file. However, that would also jeopardize his relationship with the power blocs and with the holders of vested interests.' Xi's accession marks only the second orderly transfer of power in more than six decades of Communist Party rule.He was the only candidate for president in Thursday's ballot in the country's figurehead parliament. The delegates voted 2,952-to-1 for Xi in a political ritual designed to echo the views of the party leadership.After the result was announced, Xi bowed to delegates and turned to Hu, seated next to him. The two of them shook hands and posed for photos.Xi, the son of a veteran political leader instrumental in the progress of China's revolution, was also appointed chairman of the government commission that oversees the military.Li Yuanchao, a liberal-minded reformer and a close ally of Hu, was named vice-president. Controversially, Li is not in the party's seven-member ruling inner sanctum.Xi takes charge at a time when the public is looking for leadership to address sputtering economic growth and mounting anger over widespread graft, high-handed officialdom and increasing unfairness.A growth-at-all-costs model that defined the outgoing administration's era has polluted the country's air, waterways and soil, adding another serious threat to social stability.                  Spectacle: The handover of power came at a meeting of the National People's Congress in Beijing      Spectacle: But the National People's Congress largely exists to rubber-stamp leaders' decisions          Voting: Delegates examine their ballot papers, an unusual sight in the undemocratic state      Setting the scene: A hostess arranges Xi's seat before the start of Thursday's session   'At present, the party and the government have very little public credibility,' said Zhang Ming, a China politics expert at the prestigious Renmin University in Beijing. 'The way to regain credibility is to at least show some results, but at this point that can't be seen and I predict there won't be any real results later.'Ahead of the votes on the government's top slots, legislators approved a government restructuring plan only four days after it was introduced.Among other things, the plan abolishes the Railways Ministry and combines two agencies that regulate newspapers and broadcasters into a super media regulator. It also merges the Health Ministry with the commission that oversees the one-child law.In a reflection of China's growing international engagement, the role of president has evolved since the 1990s from being purely ceremonial to a position which lends legitimacy to the government and draws attention away from the Communist Party.'As China opens up and becomes more engaged in the international community, it's just impractical, it's not convenient, for a party head to meet a foreign head of state,' said Warren Sun, an expert on Communist Party history at Monash University in Australia.

He quickly moved to court the military after taking over from Hu as head of the party's Central Military Commission, making high-profile visits to naval, air force and infantry bases.Xi has also sought to please other constituencies. He made a trip to the south to show he's interested in economic reforms, repeatedly stated his staunch belief in party power to appeal to hardliners, visited the poor to burnish his common-man credentials and espoused the 'Chinese Dream' to tap into middle class aspirations.But for Xi to consolidate his power within the party, he will come up against various interest groups such as the sons and daughters of communist China's founding fathers who want to keep benefiting from their connections, or those with links to banks and state industries who don't want their privileged positions threatened.Ideologically, there are those who believe China needs an even stronger, more authoritarian government that promotes more egalitarian economic and social policies. Others want a transition to more democratic government.  "

China's President Xi Jinping speaks on November 9, 2014, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Beijing ©Wang Zhao (Pool/AFP) It will see Beijing push its preferred Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), while Washington is driving its own Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).The TPP is seen as the economic element of the much-touted US ""rebalance"" to Asia and so far brings together 12 APEC nations including Japan and Australia -- but not China.Obama left Washington Sunday, with the White House saying he was expected to have ""candid and in-depth conversations"" with Xi, after Secretary of State John Kerry last week described the two powers' relationship as the ""most consequential"" in the world.""For the Asia-Pacific and the world at large, China's development will generate huge opportunities and benefits and hold lasting and infinite promise,"" Xi said.He later welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he has a shared outlook on issues such as trade, investment and geopolitical interests, including a wariness of the United States.It was ""time to gather fruit"" from ""the tree of Russian-Chinese relations"", Xi told Putin, as the two sides signed agreements stepping up their multi-billion-dollar energy and resources cooperation.- Chinese dream -Xi told the business meeting his ""Asia-Pacific dream"" was based on a ""shared destiny"" of peace, development and mutual benefit in the region.The comments have echoes of the ""Chinese dream"" he regularly speaks of, an unspecified but much-discussed term with connotations of national resurgence.Beijing -- a veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council -- is leveraging the decades-long boom that has made it the world's second-largest economy to increase its regional and global heft.But it stresses a policy of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs -- a stance that has enabled it to do business with leaders seen as pariahs in the West.Its relationship with the United States has been marred by tensions over trade disputes, cyberspying and human rights issues, while Beijing is embroiled in enduring disputes with Tokyo over islands in the East China Sea, and with rival claimants in the South China Sea.Under Xi, it has been asserting those claims more firmly.""China wants to live in harmony with all its neighbours,"" he said Sunday.Nonetheless, relations with Japan have plunged in recent years with both sides sending ships and aircraft to the islands, which are controlled by Tokyo and claimed by Beijing, raising fears of clashes.Hopes of an ice-breaking formal meeting between Xi and Abe on the sidelines of the summit have risen following statements by the two countries agreeing to try to improve ties.But Japanese officials say the key sentence in their statement was ""very carefully written"" to avoid Tokyo formally acknowledging that there was a dispute on sovereignty over the islands.""We did not give in to the Chinese demand,"" one official said.- 'Not that scary' -China's decades-long economic boom has seen it overtake Japan as the world's second-largest economy. But its growth reached a five-year low in the third quarter.Xi said the risks it faced were ""not that scary"" and slower expansion was expected as its economy matures.China currently suffers from a deflating property bubble, a crackdown on corruption blamed for curbing some business, and weak demand from Europe.Even so it was expected to invest more than $1.25 trillion abroad over the next decade, Xi said, while outbound Chinese tourists would exceed 500 million over the next five years.As ""China's overall national strength grows"", he told his audience, it would be able and willing to offer ""new initiatives and visions for enhancing regional cooperation"".A draft summit communique seen by AFP calls for a ""strategic study"" on the Beijing-backed FTAAP. But Michael Froman, the US Trade Representative, told reporters Sunday: ""It’s not the launch of a new organisation, it's not the launch of a new FTA.""FTAAP, he said, was a ""long-term aspiration"" to be achieved only through other existing negotiations such as TPP, which was ""clearly"" the priority for the world's biggest economy.The communique refers to ""the eventual realisation"" of the FTAAP.But whether the leaders will endorse the so-called ""Beijing Roadmap"" towards the FTAAP remained unclear.

Hobart, which is home to the Australian Antarctic Division, is a key shipping gateway to the area.The signing capped a whirlwind trip to the so-called Apple Isle by the Chinese leader, who has visited every other Australian state and territory and joked Monday that he should receive a certificate for his travels across the country.- Moved by students' letter -Xi said he chose to visit the southern state following the weekend G20 summit in Brisbane after receiving a letter from primary school students in Launceston in the state's north.""In their letter, they describe Tasmania's unique products and beautiful scenery, they hand-wrote the letter in Chinese,"" Xi said in his address to the Australian parliament in Canberra Monday.""And their words have filled me with curiosity.""Andy Muller, principal of Scotch Oakburn College, told AFP his students were thrilled about their meeting with the president and it was ""one of the most exciting days of their lives"".""The president invited them to come to China to visit, sightsee and study, and the students are all very motivated to continue with their Chinese and go over there.""Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan were warmly welcomed when they touched down in Hobart and were introduced to three orphaned baby Tasmanian devils, the black, furry native animal named for the state.Dozens of Xi supporters waving flags and banners also gathered outside the state's government house and at Hobart wharf where the agreement was signed.Tasmania, which in 1980 became the sister state of Fujian province where Xi previously served as governor, is hoping to cash in on the growing economic clout of China's middle classes through food and wine exports, renewable energy projects and tourism.The state's Premier Will Hodgman signed four agreements with China in Canberra on Monday which will increase Tasmania's links with the China Development Bank Corporation and with Fujian and Shaanxi provinces as well as supporting the development of a wind farm.Peter Chung, a third-generation Chinese Australian and retired businessman, said Xi's visit would help to put the state on the map.""When I travelled overseas, not many people I met knew where Tasmania was,"" Chung, who was the president of Tasmania's Chinese Community Association for three decades, told AFP.""But now, people say -- I know where it is.""China is the largest source of international visitors to Tasmania, with a 61 percent increase in the number of tourists to 20,400 in the year to June, Tourism Tasmania data showed.Xi on Monday signed a historic free-trade agreement with Australia in Canberra.

Beijing is understood to be keen on investing 100 billion dollars in the country in the next five years.          Big spender: Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive on September 17.Xi’s big-ticket investments coincide with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream of high-speed trains, smart cities, roads and ports, and mega infrastructure and power projects. India and China will explore the road ahead for Gujarat leading the manufacturing hub project, on the lines of development in Guandong. Two industrial parks - one each in Gandhinagar and Pune - are expected to be announced during this high-profile visit. The Chinese automobile industry is keen to make its presence in Pune and will be exploring options. China wants to invest big-time in bullet trains and other high-speed trains (150-160 km/hr plus), lay the track, invest in automation system and also work on the Metro train system in many of the 50 cities where MRTS (Mass Rapid Transit System) projects are a part of Modi’s dream.The Asian giant seeks to invest in ports, energy sector and also move forward on a key Modi government project - interlinking of rivers and dredging. China, according to sources, has attractive plans for projects close to the prime minister's heart. China’s aim is to tell India that both the neighbours have to overcome the trust deficit of 1962, and the Gujarat meeting is all about bringing the personal touch to the improved relationship that Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping can provide, the sources said."
4,Chinese universities start 'Xi Thought' institutes,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5030637/Chinese-universities-start-Xi-Thought-institutes.html," 06:43 BST, 30 October 2017 ","          A slogan in a Beijing street reads ""Promote Xi's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, making it a lively practice in Beijing""  Xi Jinping Thought will now be taught, researched and promoted in universities across China, ensuring that the leader's eponymous philosophy is implanted in students' hearts and minds. At least twenty universities have established research institutes for Xi's ideology, which was enshrined in the Communist Party's constitution during its 19th national congress this month. The distinction places Xi on a par with Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. It means that his dogma -- ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era"" -- will become a mantra for a new generation. According to media reports Sunday, the research institutes will not ""hide in the ivory tower"" but advocate the incorporation of Xi thought in all aspects of daily life. ""We will gather many experts and professors to disseminate and preach Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in businesses, neighbourhoods and villages,"" Jiang Hongxin, head of Hunan Normal University's newly-founded Xi Thought research centre, told the People's Daily, the party mouthpiece. Liu Ying, party secretary of the Tianjin University of Technology's Communist Youth League, told AFP the idea of forming a Xi Thought ""learning group"" came to her spontaneously during his marathon speech at the congress's opening. ""After studying these ideas, students will have more confidence not only in the country, but also in their own lives,"" she said. ""They will have a greater belief in the Chinese dream"" -- one of Xi's pet slogans. Planned activities for the group include tours to promote Xi Thought in rural communities and visits to Liangjiahe, the northern village where Xi spent seven years as a ""sent-down youth"" during the Cultural Revolution. Liu's attitude mirrors that of many institute directors, who in interviews with Chinese media over the weekend espoused a deep devotion to spreading Xi-isms. ""The (research) centre has a unique duty, which is to push forward Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in curriculums, in classrooms and in minds,"" Chen Xianda, a professor at Renmin University of China, told the Beijing-based Guangming Daily. One institute director said the lessons must ""enter brains and hearts,"" while another said the Xi Thought organisation would ""guide the entire school, from top to bottom, in implementing the spirit of the 19th congress"". The education ministry also released guidelines Monday for mandatory elementary and high school extracurricular programmes that include activities to ""foster emotional attachment to the Chinese Communist Party""."

Xi said the nation was committed to economic reforms in 2018, the 40th anniversary of the transformation led by Deng Xiaoping, ""as reform and opening-up is the path we must take to make progress in contemporary China and to realise the Chinese dream"". In a speech quoted by the state Xinhua news agency, Xi said that by 2020 all rural residents living below the current poverty line should have been lifted out of poverty. It would be the first time in thousands of years of Chinese history that extreme poverty had been eliminated, he said. ""It is our solemn promise,"" Xi said. The president also acknowledged shortfalls in the government's work. ""That is why we should strengthen our sense of responsibility and do a good job of ensuring the people's well-being,"" Xinhua quoted him as saying. ""The well-being of our people is the Party and the government's greatest political achievement."" On international affairs, Xi said China ""will resolutely uphold the authority of the United Nations"", actively fulfil the nation's international obligations and remain firmly committed to its pledges to tackle climate change. His stance puts him at odds with US President Donald Trump, who has sharply criticised the UN and vowed to quit the 2015 Paris accord on combating climate change."
6,Beijing official urges efforts for Xi's 'Chinese Dream',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5457337/Top-Chinese-official-urges-outreach-diaspora.html," 09:29 BST, 3 March 2018 "," BEIJING (AP) - A top Chinese official called Saturday for continued efforts to rally non-mainland ethnic Chinese, including those overseas, around the country's national interests and help realize President Xi Jinping's ""Chinese Dream"" of national rejuvenation. The comments from Yu Zhengsheng come amid heightened Western scrutiny of the Communist Party's attempts to exert control and influence abroad, including over the Chinese diaspora in countries like Australia and the United States. In a speech at the opening of a largely ceremonial political advisory conference, Yu said the advisory body has ""meticulously"" worked to enhance patriotism among young people in Hong Kong and Macau as well as those farther abroad with invitations to visit China and outbound delegations.          Chinese President Xi Jinping is seen on a large screen at the opening session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Saturday, March 3, 2018. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)  He said he was seeking to ""mobilize all the sons and daughters of (ethnic Chinese) to work together for the greater national interests and the realization of the Chinese Dream,"" referring to Xi's nationalist vision of China as the pre-eminent global power. China's Communist Party has long claimed sovereignty over the self-governing island of Taiwan - and a degree of authority over all ethnic Chinese, regardless of nationality - but its attitude toward the Chinese diaspora has been a source of growing friction with foreign governments over the past year. In Australia and the United States, law enforcement officials have warned about Chinese government attempts to influence national politics and public opinion, as well as monitor the activities and speech of Chinese students studying abroad. In another instance, European officials were deeply alarmed after Chinese police detained and denied consular visits to a naturalized Swedish bookseller in a diplomatic standoff, with Chinese state media editorial deriding his Swedish passport as effectively meaningless. The annual Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, headed by Yu since 2013, is mostly ceremonial but designed to present an image of a diverse, big-tent advisory body that includes non-Communist Party members, minority ethnic groups, business leaders, religious groups, artists, and representatives from Hong Kong and Macau all taking part in China's governance. In opening speeches in past years, the chairman has often repudiated Western democratic concepts, such as the separation of powers, and issued warnings against formal independence for Taiwan. Yu struck a less hawkish tone on Saturday, as he called for more overseas exchanges to ""deepen solidarity and friendship with our compatriots in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan as well as overseas Chinese,"" and efforts to build international goodwill around the Belt and Road transcontinental infrastructure project - Xi's signature foreign policy initiative. The advisory body will continue working domestically to ""create a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation,"" including among religious minorities and the country's poorest citizens, he said. The annual CPPCC meeting runs concurrently with the two-week session of the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament. Economic issues typically dominate the conferences, but the sessions this year could be overshadowed by a controversial proposal to amend the constitution to remove term limits and allow Xi to remain in office indefinitely.

Xi and PLA officers and soldiers sang the national anthem at the inauguration ceremony Thursday.Xi said the three new units had been created as part of a modernization reform and ""to realize the Chinese dream of a strong military.""China's military is currently 2.3 million strong but there are plans to cut it by 300,000.Xi has promulgated the idea of a ""Chinese dream"" involving ""the great renewal of the Chinese nation"" and sees a strong military as key to this.The military reform comes as China has become more assertive in pressing its claims to territory in the East China Sea and South China Sea, increasing tensions with its neighbors.Other reform plans include phasing out old equipment, developing new weapons systems and reducing troop numbers."
8,Chinese president presents 2 giant pandas to Berlin zoo,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4667312/Chinese-president-meeting-Merkel-visiting-pandas-Berlin.html," 11:52 BST, 5 July 2017 "," BERLIN (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping officially presented two giant pandas to Berlin's zoo on Wednesday, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the bamboo-munching newcomers would be ""special ambassadors"" for the two countries. The pandas, Meng Meng and Jiao Qing, landed in Berlin on June 24 and have been settling in at the zoo since, out of public view. Merkel and Xi, who was visiting the German capital ahead of the Group of 20 summit that starts Friday, inaugurated the bears' glass-fronted compound. The pandas appeared unfazed by the celebrity welcome and placidly chewed bamboo as a red curtain was drawn back to reveal the zoo's newest residents.

(Axel Schmidt/pool photo via AP)  Meng Meng and Jiao Qing's arrival in Germany was preceded by lengthy bilateral negotiations, since giant pandas are unique to China and sent abroad as diplomatic envoys. The pandas will be on loan from China for 15 years. ""I hope that the two new arrivals can quickly settle down in their second home and, perhaps, one day will have offspring,"" Xi said. He added, ""I hope that the two pandas ... can further deepen the friendship between our two countries."" Jiao Qing, which means ""darling,"" is a 7-year-old male and weighs 108 kilograms (238 pounds.) Female Meng Meng, which translates to ""sweet dream"" in English, is 3 years old and weighs 77 kilograms (169 pounds). Their residency ends a five-year period in which the Berlin zoo had no pandas. The city's last panda, Bao Bao, died in 2012. Bao Bao was sent in 1980 as a gift from then-Chinese leader Hua Guofeng to West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. ""Now we have two very likable diplomats here - the two pandas - and I think Jiao Qing and Meng Meng will be special ambassadors for our two countries,"" Merkel said.

However, we have the confidence to conquer all forms of invasion,' Xi told government leaders and current and retired PLA members gathered at the hulking Great Hall of the People, the seat of the legislature that sits beside Tiananmen Square.'We absolutely will not permit any person, any organization, any political party - at any time, in any form - to separate any piece of Chinese territory from China,' Xi said to applause.        Taking the lead: President Xi said that China would never 'swallow the bitter fruit of damage our sovereignty, security and development interests'       Chinese paramilitary policemen march outside the Great Hall of the People after attending a ceremony to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing       Ruling party: Chinese President Xi Jinping, left, and Premier Li Keqiang applaud during the anniversary ceremony on Tuesday'No one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit of damage to our sovereignty, security and development interests.'Xi made no reference to any specific conflicts or disputes during his address, which focused largely on the PLA's growth from a scrappy guerrilla force fighting Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and Japanese invaders into one of the world's most powerful, if largely untested, militaries.However, China is currently engaged in a weeks-long border standoff with Indian forces near the countries' disputed border high in the Himalayas, with Chinese spokesmen demanding that Indian troops withdraw to avoid a clash potentially worse than the brief but bloody war the two fought in the region in 1962.China has also long been embroiled in a contest with Japan over East China Sea islands, as well as with five other governments over competing claims to territory in the strategically vital South China Sea. Beijing also threatens to use force to conquer Taiwan if peaceful enticements prove insufficient. China considers the self-governing democratic island Chinese territory.In his speech, Xi also emphasized that the military's highest loyalty is to the ruling Communist Party, underscoring the PLA's key role as regime preserver through crises such as the bloody suppression of 1989 pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square. Top Chinese leaders have consistently rejected calls to make the PLA loyal to the government and people instead.'The people's army will resolutely safeguard the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our country's socialist system, resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and resolutely safeguard regional and world peace,' Xi said.

Last week, Xi bestowed newly created 'Aug. 1' honors on servicemen in a further elevation of the armed forces' stature.Xi and his predecessors engineered a radical upgrading of the PLA's capabilities through years of double-digit percentage increases in the defense budget, making China the world's second-largest military spender after the United States, although growth has slowed alongside a cooling of the overall economy.That has also spurred a global role for the PLA, which was formerly overwhelmingly preoccupied with securing China's territorial integrity.Alongside its blue-water navy, China is building its first overseas military base in the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti, and Chinese ships held drills last month with Russia's navy in the Baltic Sea, more than 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) from their home ports.

China's rubber-stamp parliament cleared the way for Xi Jinping to remain in power indefinitely         Delegates listen to a speech by China's President Xi Jinping as he is seen on a large screen during the closing session of the National People's Congress at The Great Hall Of The PeopleThe two-week session of the National People's Congress handed Xi, 64, a second term and endorsed the Communist Party's decision to lift presidential term limits, clearing the way for him to remain in power indefinitely after his new term ends in 2023. His eponymous political philosophy, which was enshrined in the party charter last year, was added to the national constitution and senior government officials had to swear an oath to the document for the first time.Some of Xi's key lieutenants were also promoted to top positions. His former anti-corruption czar, Wang Qishan, was elevated to the vice presidency while his top economic adviser, Liu He, became vice premier.Wang could use his experience as a trade negotiator to deal with rocky relations with the Trump administration, while Liu is expected to have an influential role in economic policymaking. Why could Chinese President Xi stay in power for life? China's rubber-stamp lawmakers passed a historic constitutional amendment on March 11 that abolished presidential term limits and would enable President Xi Jinping to rule indefinitely.The National People's Congress's nearly 3,000 hand-picked delegates endorsed the constitutional amendment, voting 2,958 in favour with two opposed, three abstaining and one vote invalidated.The move reversed the era of 'collective' leadership and orderly succession that was promoted by form Deng Xiaoping to ensure stability following the turbulent one-man rule of Communist China's founder Mao Zedong.  The vote has also made Xi Jinping China’s most powerful ruler since Chairman Mao, who rule China from 1949 to his death in 1976.         Trump is considering new punitive measures against China over its 'theft' of US intellectual property, raising fears of a tit-for-tat trade war.'We hope that both parties can maintain reason, not act emotionally, and avoid a trade war,' Premier Li Keqiang told a press conference after Xi's speech.On the domestic front, the legislature approved the biggest government shake-up in years, merging the banking and insurance regulators to tackle financial risks, and amended the constitution to expand the Communist Party's role in the country's affairs.Xi's campaign against corruption within the Communist Party, which punished 1.5 million officials in five years, was expanded as the legislature voted Tuesday to create a national agency that will scrutinise millions of public servants.'The Communist Party of China must... resolutely eliminate' corruption, Xi said.

11,Xi is everywhere: China's omnipresent leader,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4991484/Xi-Chinas-omnipresent-leader.html," 05:52 BST, 18 October 2017 ","          Xi Jinping is the first Chinese leader to be born after 1949, when the Communist revolution that gives the party its legitimacy ended  Chinese President Xi Jinping's stiff smile greets visitors in room after room at a Beijing exhibition put up by the Communist party to tout its past five years of accomplishments. ""Five Years On"" looks at China's changes since 2012 -- when Xi came to power -- ahead of the twice-a-decade party congress which opened Wednesday. Xi's omnipresence at the Soviet-style Beijing Exhibition Centre is yet another example of the cult of personality that the state propaganda machine has wrapped around the most powerful Chinese leader in decades. Alongside every flow chart and diorama on display in the red star-topped building loomed a larger-than-life photo of the president: commanding a lectern, striding alongside farmers or foreign dignitaries, inspecting a steel plant, even aiming a gun alongside troops in Macau. Other displays showed five-year-old menus and receipts from modest meals Xi ate while inspecting villages in the countryside. His fans flocked to the exhibit. ""We don't find the photos weird. We grew up in this environment,"" said finance manager Liu Wen, 35, pointing out that the face of modern China's founder, Mao Zedong, graces every yuan bill. ""It's not a cult of personality, because as people from a collectivist society, when we see Xi Dada, we think of the team behind him, not of him as an individual hero,"" he added, using a chummy nickname coined for the leader by party propaganda organs that roughly equates to ""Big Uncle Xi."" Xi's ever-expanding power and intolerance for dissent has earned him comparisons to Mao. - Party rise - While his father was purged under the Communist leader, 64-year-old Xi rose through the ranks without scandal, thanks to an unassuming demeanour that earned him fewer rivals than most. ""He believes that the party is the force that can really transform China,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, China politics specialist at Hong Kong Baptist University. Beginning as a county-level party secretary, Xi rose to become governor of coastal Fujian province, then party secretary of Zhejiang province and eventually Shanghai, in 2007.          The son of revolutionary hero Xi Zhongxun, China's president Xi Jinping was born in Beijing in 1953 into privilege  That same year, he was appointed to China's top governing body, the Politburo Standing Committee, a group he has led since 2012 as general secretary. Xi is now expected to secure a second five-year term as head of the party during the congress, like his predecessors. But more importantly, he will have the opportunity to stack key positions with loyalists. Xi is the first Chinese leader to have been born after 1949, when the Communist revolution that gives the party its legitimacy ended. The son of revolutionary hero Xi Zhongxun, he was born in Beijing in 1953 into privilege. A so-called ""princeling"" who reaped the benefits of his father's acclaim, Xi studied chemical engineering at the prestigious Tsinghua University before turning to politics. After a divorce, Xi married his second wife, the celebrity soprano Peng Liyuan, in 1987, at a time when she was much more famous than him. The couple's daughter, Xi Mingze, studied at Harvard and stays out of the public eye. - 'Closer to us' - But official media have aggressively shaped an image for Xi as a man of the people, who dresses modestly and buys his own steamed buns at a common shop. They have also highlighted the time he spent during the Cultural Revolution as a ""sent-down youth"" in the countryside, labouring alongside farmers and living in a cave.          ""Chinese Dream, People's Dream"" reads a poster in Beijing featuring President Xi Jinping  In the run-up to the congress, state media touted his accomplishments, running a video series on his growing diplomatic clout and stories on the poverty alleviation programme of the man now known as the ""core"" of the Communist Party. The propaganda, however, glosses over the series of crackdowns on activists, lawyers and academics that Xi has overseen. Authorities have also clamped down on what can be said on the internet, tightening censorship in a country where young people are avid users of social media. That very definitely includes what can be said about Xi Dada -- even obliquely. Since comparisons were first made in 2013 between China's leader and a certain portly yellow bear who likes ""hunny"", references to the most famous inhabitant of Hundred Acre Wood have periodically been blocked. As the congress got under way on Wednesday, a Chinese language search on Weibo for ""Winnie the Pooh"" and ""Xi Jinping"" returned the message: ""According to relevent laws and policy, the search results are not displayed."""
12,What is Xi thinking? China's leader makes the constitution,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5012343/What-Xi-thinking-Chinas-leader-makes-constitution.html," 13:22 BST, 24 October 2017 ","          Chinese President Xi Jinping (C) raises his hand to vote for the reports with other leaders at the closing of the 19th Communist Party Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on October 24, 2017  China's most powerful leader in decades entered Communist Party folklore on Tuesday when cadres voted overwhelmingly to engrave the Xi Jinping way into their constitution. ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,"" adds a new section to the already-weighty party tome, and puts the 64-year-old Chinese president in distinguished company. Only two other men -- Communist China's founder Mao Zedong, and the architect of market reforms, Deng Xiaoping -- have previously been granted such an honour. Here are some things to know about the move. What does it mean? China has a state constitution, which governs how the country is run, but the Communist Party that has ruled the world's most populous nation since 1949 has its own charter for its 89 million members. With Xi's name newly inked in the party constitution, disputes can be crushed and rivals can be parried with a swift look at the rulebook. ""It means his authority has been recognised by the entire party,"" said Chinese political scholar Hu Xingdou. Not only that, but the way Xi thinks will seep through the collective political conscious -- all the way down to the youngest members of society. Officials have plans to cement Xi Thought into hearts and minds across China, with the country's education minister telling reporters that it would be incorporated into school curriculums. ""(The thought will) go into textbooks, into classes, and into the brains (of students),"" Chen Baosheng said, according to the South China Morning Post. What thoughts, exactly? Xi sketched the outlines of his philosophy in a mammoth opening address spanning three and a half hours last Wednesday, although he has been incorporating his principles into CCP rhetoric for years. Broad brushstrokes include banner notions such as a ""moderately prosperous society"" and the ""great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" ""The principal contradiction facing Chinese society in the new era,"" Xi said in his speech, ""is that between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people's ever-growing needs for a better life."" For a party that came into power promising a radical redistribution of the nation's wealth, success on this front is crucial for credibility. Shortly after taking office in 2012, Xi also popularised the notion of a ""Chinese Dream,"" the comprehensive realisation of a modernised party and nation united under socialism with Chinese characteristics. Now that dream has been defined as one for the ""new era"" -- an era with Xi at its helm. How did it go down? In the highly-choreographed world of Communist Party Congress, Xi's wisdom was tremendously well received. Mentions of ""Xi Thought"" (the philosophy's state-approved shorthand) echoed through Beijing's Great Hall of the People during the week-long congress. ""We have entered the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics with General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core,"" Yang Baofeng, a delegate from northeast Heilongjiang province, told AFP Tuesday. Li Hualiang, a village party branch secretary in northeast Jilin province, called the ideology a ""very great formulation and innovation."" ""There were absolutely no dissenting opinions. This is normal,"" he said. ""Now our country is unified, cohesive and moving up in the world."" Meanwhile, state media has trumpeted the proliferation of the philosophy. ""Xi's speech hailed as inspirational, thought-provoking,"" said one headline from the official Xinhua news agency. How does it stack up against the others? With a title more than double the length of the other constitutionally-approved philosophies -- Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory -- the addition of Xi to the charter solidifies his place as a Chinese leader that history will reckon with. Mao is the only other figure in Chinese history to have been honoured in this way while he was still alive, triggering speculation that Xi will hang onto power well beyond the standard two terms after his second mandate ends in 2022. Xi's predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, had concepts included in the constitution but without their names, and then only when they shuffled off into retirement -- the Communist Party equivalent of a testimonial football match."

The end goal is the ""Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"", set for 2050, when Xi expects China will return to its rightful status after over a century of bowing to the demands of Western powers. All former top leaders of the party have had guiding theories. Before Xi, Hu Jintao put foward a ""scientific outlook on development"", and Jiang Zemin, before him, had the ""three represents"". But Xi Thought differs from previous ideologies in that it carries his name and was written into the party charter while he was still in office - honours only given to Mao previously. Xi Thought is a smorgasbord of sayings, slogans, historic allusions and literary references, all of which are the subject of numerous dedicated social media accounts and spin-off books explaining exactly what Xi means. Below is a selection of some key tenets. CORE SOCIALIST VALUES A set of 12 values to guide individuals, society and the nation: patriotism, democracy, civility, harmony, power through wealth, justice, freedom, equality, rule of law, industriousness, sincerity and friendliness. THE FOUR COMPREHENSIVES This slogan guides Xi's twin drives to clean out the rot of corruption in the Chinese Communist Party and set up an even-firmer system of party rule. Four aspects of political rule must be followed: strict governance by the party, rule of law, pushing forward reform, and building a moderately prosperous society, an ancient Confucian term for everyone being basically well-off. THE CHINESE DREAM This is arguably the core of Xi's thinking. It says that all people should strive to make China ""prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful"" by 2050. Similar in aspects to the American dream, China's version is about achieving prosperity for the Chinese people, but rather than the freedom to pursue individual wealth and happiness, being well-off is inextricably tied to the ""great rejuvenation"" of the nation. THE FIVE DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS Xi's theoretical underpinning for the practical questions about how China's economy should develop - in a green, innovative, coordinated, shared and open manner. These ideas are meant to guide China to avoid a hard landing for a slowing economy, boost consumption, improve innovation and services-based growth, and tackle hazardous pollution. COMMUNITY OF COMMON DESTINY FOR MANKIND This is the lofty concept that is meant to guide China's relations with the rest of the world. A ""new style"" of international relations is proposed that is ""win-win"" and of ""mutual benefit"" for all, but many Western nations remain critical of China's regional behaviour over issues such as the contested waters of the South China Sea. Some academics say the concept is an attempt to counter fears of China's rise and to avoid conflict with existing powers. (Reporting by Christian Shepherd; Editing by Philip McClellan)"

Four aspects of political rule must be followed: strict governance by the party, rule of law, pushing forward reform, and building a moderately prosperous society, an ancient Confucian term for everyone being basically well-off. THE CHINESE DREAM This is arguably the core of Xi's thinking. It says that all people should strive to make China ""prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful"" by 2050. Similar in aspects to the American dream, China's version is about achieving prosperity for the Chinese people, but rather than the freedom to pursue individual wealth and happiness, being well-off is inextricably tied to the ""great rejuvenation"" of the nation. THE FIVE DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS Xi's theoretical underpinning for the practical questions about how China's economy should develop - in a green, innovative, coordinated, shared and open manner. These ideas are meant to guide China to avoid a hard landing for a slowing economy, boost consumption, improve innovation and services-based growth, and tackle hazardous pollution. COMMUNITY OF COMMON DESTINY FOR MANKIND This is the lofty concept that is meant to guide China's relations with the rest of the world. A ""new style"" of international relations is proposed that is ""win-win"" and of ""mutual benefit"" for all, but many Western nations remain critical of China's regional behaviour over issues such as the contested waters of the South China Sea. Some academics say the concept is an attempt to counter fears of China's rise and to avoid conflict with existing powers. (Reporting by Christian Shepherd; Editing by Philip McClellan)"

Xi told participants in a conference of Arab leaders in Beijing that Syria, Yemen, Jordan and Lebanon would receive $91 million in humanitarian assistance. Another $151 million was earmarked for aid projects, with the remaining $23 billion designated for financial and economic cooperation, Xi said. No details were given about how or when the money would be dispersed.

China has expanded its influence among Arab states both for economic purposes and to counter the influence of Washington and Europe. Saudi Arabia was China's second-largest source of crude oil last year and Iraq was its third biggest supplier at the start of 2018. The Middle East is also a key node in China's ""Belt and Road"" initiative that envisages linking Beijing to other parts of Asia, Europe and Africa via a network of ports, railways, economic development zones and power plants. China ""supports the construction of a future logistics network connecting Central Asia with east Africa and the Indian Ocean with the Mediterranean,"" Xi told the conference. Politically, China has sought a role as an intermediary between Israel and the Palestinians and provided diplomatic cover for Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country's seven-year civil war.

16,FACTBOX-China's new Politburo Standing Committee lineup,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-5014929/Chinas-new-Politiburo-Standing-Committee-lineup.html," 05:30 BST, 25 October 2017 "," Oct 25 (Reuters) - China's ruling Communist Party on Wednesday unveiled its core decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee, headed by President Xi Jinping. Here is the list of the new committee, all men, by order of seniority: - Xi Jinping, 64, is widely seen as China's most powerful leader since Chairman Mao Zedong. He was once viewed as a drab ""princeling"" child of the elite. But since soaring to power in 2012, Xi has centralised authority under his own leadership with a signature anti-graft battle. His political theory - ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era"" - was written into the Party constitution on Tuesday. - Li Keqiang, 62, as premier has overseen China's economy for the last five years. Li's policies have sought to spur entrepreneurship and innovation, but he has been increasingly overshadowed by Xi, who has thrown his weight behind reforms to make state sector firms ""stronger, better and bigger"" and to manage financial stability. - Li Zhanshu, 67, heads the party's General Office. He worked his way up from Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, and graduated from Hebei Normal University. A former governor of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and one-time party boss of the southwestern province of Guizhou, Li Zhanshu is considered one of Xi's closest advisors and often accompanies him on overseas trips. Their friendship dates back to their days working together in Hebei in the 1980s. - Wang Yang, 62, is a vice premier with an economic portfolio and a former party chief of Guangdong province, an export powerhouse, where he served from 2007-2012. Born into a poor rural family in eastern Anhui province, Wang went to work in a factory at age 17 to support his family after his father died. Concerned about the impact of three decades of rapid development, he lobbied for social and political reform. However, he backed down after drawing criticism from party conservatives. - Wang Huning, 62 this month, was a top policy researcher for the party under former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, a position he has kept under Xi as head of the Central Policy Research Office. Wang coined the ""Three Represents"" and ""Scientific Outlook of Development"" - respectively Jiang and Hu's contributions to party thought, as well as the ""Chinese Dream"", Xi's own vision. Wang was formerly an academic at Shanghai's Fudan University, specialising first in international relations and then law. He is also considered one of Xi's closest advisors. - Zhao Leji, 60, was also named the Chinese Communist Party's new anti-corruption chief on Wednesday. He was named vice governor of the northwestern province of Qinghai in 1994 at age 37. Zhao spent 29 years in Qinghai before being picked by Xi to serve as party boss of Shaanxi province, in the northwest, in 2007. Both Zhao and Xi are natives of Shaanxi. Zhao heads the powerful organisation department, which oversees personnel decisions, and is a Politburo member. He has a degree in philosophy from Peking University. - Han Zheng, 63, is party chief of Shanghai, China's financial hub, where he has spent his entire career. Han was briefly promoted from Shanghai mayor after the then-party boss was sacked amid a corruption scandal in 2006. He resumed his mayoral role as Xi Jinping and then Yu Zhengsheng - currently the party's fourth-ranked leader - became party chief. Han became Shanghai party boss in 2012.

17,Xi to meet FIFA boss as China harbours World Cup ambition,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4594976/Xi-meet-FIFA-boss-China-harbours-World-Cup-ambition.html," 06:03 BST, 12 June 2017 ","          China's football-mad President Xi Jinping will meet with FIFA chief Gianni Infantino (pictured) in Beijing on June 14, 2017, as the world's most populous nation harbours ambitions of hosting the World Cup  China's football-mad President Xi Jinping will meet FIFA chief Gianni Infantino in Beijing on Wednesday as the world's most populous nation harbours ambitions of hosting the World Cup. Xi will greet the president of football's world governing body at the palatial Great Hall of the People. ""We hope we can strengthen our cooperation on football with international organisations, including FIFA, and also with other countries,"" foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular press briefing. ""As to whether China will host the World Cup, this is a dream shared by many Chinese. We also hope we can see that happen as soon as possible,"" Lu said. The meeting follows widespread speculation that China will bid to host the event either in 2030 or 2034. Xi wants his country to host the global football extravaganza and also hopes China's national team can one day win the sport's most prestigious trophy. But China, who languish at 82nd in FIFA's world rankings just below Benin and the Faroe Islands, look certain to miss out on qualification for Russia 2018. China have appeared in just one World Cup, in 2002, where they lost all three group matches and failed to score a goal. Qatar, who are part of the Asian Football Confederation, are due to host the 2022 World Cup, meaning China will not be eligible to bid for the 2026 tournament because of FIFA's policy of rotating between host continental governing bodies. Chinese Football Association vice president Zhang Jian, a member of the FIFA Council which devises its global strategy, said last year he would back a Chinese World Cup in 2030. Three major Chinese companies have signed sponsorship deals with FIFA in the space of a year, fuelling speculation that China is preparing a World Cup bid. But the Asian giant already faces stiff competition from Europe's football governing body UEFA, which is eyeing the 2030 tournament. This would leave 2034 as the next hope for Beijing."

Chinese President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist party face challenges including entrenched corruption and slowing economic growth ©Money Sharma (AFP/File) In an hour-long address broadcast live on state television, Xi praised the March as ""an epic of mankind's unremitting efforts to pursue truth and brightness"".""On the new Long March, we must maintain our ideals and faith...and consciously stay faithful to the shared ideals of communism and socialism with Chinese characteristics,"" he said, surrounded by top officials at Beijing's Great Hall of the People.The anniversary has been marked with a drumbeat of newspaper articles plus dozens of TV dramas, documentaries and special exhibitions.But some historians have said the true length of the March was shorter than the official version, and survivors have spoken of rapes, executions and forced grain requisition by the Communist troops.Such accounts are tightly censored by the party.Xi has declared the party must emulate the March’s spirit in pursuit of his ""Chinese Dream"", a vaguely defined promise of national rejuvenation.Analysts say his embrace of the Long March reflects his desire to gather the party around him and channel Mao's authority.China's governance has become more focused on the leader under Xi -- a style some have compared to Mao, whose position in the party was cemented by the March.""He is putting himself in place as the most important leader since Mao Zedong,"" party historian Zhang Lifan told AFP.But Xi ""faces a lot of problems, and factional infighting is very intense"", he added."

But while President Donald Trump faces continuing churn in his administration and a tough challenge in midterm congressional elections, China's Xi Jinping leads an outwardly stable authoritarian regime. Xi recently succeeded in pushing through a constitutional reform allowing him to rule for as long as he wishes while facing no serious electoral challenge.

Xi recently succeeded in pushing through a constitutional reform allowing him to rule for as long as he wishes while facing no serious electoral challenge. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)  ___ FRIENDLY TALK Although Trump sounded tough on the campaign trail and has challenged Beijing over trade and Taiwan, he professes admiration for his Chinese counterpart and complimented him on his ability to remove term limits on his presidential rule. ""President Xi and I will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade,"" Trump said in a tweet Sunday. ""China's great and Xi is a great gentleman,"" he said in remarks at a Republican fundraiser last month obtained by CNN. Xi has generally limited his comments to emphasizing the benefits of a close China-U.S. relationship and thanking Trump in a phone call on March 10 for congratulating him on his obtaining a second term as president. A pair of summits between the leaders in the U.S. and China over the past year were also hailed by China as successes. ___ FAMILY BACKGROUNDS Both Trump and Xi come from privileged backgrounds, although their routes to political power were decidedly different. Both, however, have built their reputations on a robust form of nationalism, with Trump promoting ""America First"" and Xi identifying himself with the ""Chinese Dream"" of rising prosperity accompanied by muscular defense and foreign policies. Trump was born the son of a New York City real estate mogul and rose to the presidency on a populist wave after a career as a property developer and reality TV star. Xi's father was a colleague of Mao Zedong, whose influence is believed to have aided his rise through a series of military, government and Communist Party positions before he was named party leader in 2012. Both also show an affection for strong-man leadership, and while American democracy is far removed from China's one-party authoritarian system, Trump's verbal attacks on the mainstream media and certain judges have drawn criticism. They both also place a strong emphasis on the military, including increased defense budgets and an appreciation for military parades, two of which Xi has led during his time in office. ___ DRIVING FORCES Xi's plan to create Chinese global competitors in fields including robotics, electric cars and pharmaceuticals is seen as precipitating the current crisis, while Trump appears motivated by a desire to shore up America's manufacturing strength. Neither wants to be seen as backing down, and though Xi's usually soft-spoken manner contrasts Trump's trademark bravado, both ""are thin-skinned bullies who place a lot of value on portraying strength,"" said Liz Economy, a leading academic on China and author of ""The Third Revolution: Xi Jinping and the New Chinese State."" ""This makes it difficult to ramp down in this one-on-one tariff death match,"" although both have the capacity via Twitter or state media to trumpet their success and ignore any failings once the dispute has concluded, Economy said. ___ LET'S MAKE A DEAL While the current dispute has focused on trade, many other factors are in play, bringing out the bargaining qualities and transactional natures of the two leaders and their administrations. Opinions on who has the upper hand differ widely. By pursuing the tariff threat and backing complaints about intellectual property theft, Trump has ""successfully changed the fundamentals of ... U.S.-China relations,"" said Miles Yu Maochun, a China politics expert at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Yu also points to recent U.S. policy on North Korea, particularly Trump's acceptance of an invitation to talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as early as next month that appeared to catch Beijing off guard. Shortly afterward, Kim paid an unexpected debut visit to China as leader in what some saw as an attempt by Beijing to reassert its centrality in resolving tensions over the North's nuclear weapons and missile programs. ___ CHINA'S CARDS Yet, as North Korea's most important trade partner and political ally, China wields considerable influence and its willingness to enforce United Nations sanctions has built up its credibility as a reliable international partner. China also stands to bring additional pressure on Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy it claims, and which is closely linked to Washington despite technically unofficial ties. While it responded mildly to Trump's early outreach to the island's independence-leaning government, recent moves such as the appointment of hawkish new National Security Adviser John Bolton, the passage of a U.S. law encouraging more intergovernmental exchanges and an agreement to pass Taiwan submarine manufacturing technology are hardening views among anti-American nationalists in China. Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office on Wednesday warned against additional moves to strengthen relations with Taiwan, amid reports that Bolton could visit the island this year. ""Any attempt to play the 'Taiwan card' would only be futile,"" spokesman Ma Xiaoguang said at a bi-weekly news conference. China, Ma said, would ""not hesitate to protect our core interests."" ___ CHALLENGES AT HOME While Yu cites domestic support for Trump's trade approach to China, Xi can likely command even stronger backing at home for a muscular approach toward what Beijing portrays as a conflict resulting from U.S. unilateralism and hegemony. Xi also faces no electoral challenge such as the one Trump's Republican party will confront in midterm congressional elections later this year, when Trump's handling of the U.S. economy and a host of other issues will be in the mix. Mindful of voters, especially in the agricultural and industrial sectors, Xi appears set to use such leverage for maximum gain. ""Xi will follow a tough but well directed path designed to hurt specific interests that will complain loudly,"" said Joseph Fewsmith, a Boston University expert on Chinese foreign policy. While Xi is broadly considered the most powerful leader since Mao, China ""only appears to be united and confident in its approach,"" said Economy, the academic, adding that the outside world has limited insight into policy debates within China.

20,Chinese president oversees military parade in show of might,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4743364/Chinese-president-oversees-military-parade-might.html," 04:04 BST, 30 July 2017 "," BEIJING (AP) - China's military has the ""confidence and capability"" to bolster the country's rise into a world power, President Xi Jinping said Sunday as he oversaw a large-scale military parade meant to show off the forces at his command to foreign and domestic audiences. Live state television broadcasts showed Xi, dressed in fatigues and speaking from an open-top jeep, telling his troops that China needed a strong military ""more than ever"" as it moved ""closer to the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" Xi, who commands the People's Liberation Army as chairman of the Central Military Commission, has frequently spoken of his ""China Dream"" to restore China to a leadership position in international affairs with a modern, far-reaching military force to match.          In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, Chinese President Xi Jinping stands on a military jeep as he inspects troops of the People's Liberation Army during a military parade to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the founding of the PLA at Zhurihe training base in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Sunday, July 30, 2017. China's military has the ""confidence and capability"" to bolster the country's rise into a world power, President Xi Jinping said Sunday as he oversaw a large-scale military parade meant to show off the forces at his command to foreign and domestic audiences. (Li Gang/Xinhua via AP)  The parade at the Zhurihe military training base in China's Inner Mongolia region was also a sign domestically of how Xi has enhanced his control over the PLA, just as he has over every other political power base within the sprawling Communist Party, ahead of a pivotal party congress this autumn. A Communist Party ""princeling"" fond of deploying revolutionary lore and nationalistic rhetoric, Xi declared the PLA ready to defeat all ""invading enemies"" as he celebrated the 90th anniversary of the PLA's founding. It was the first time a parade has been held to mark the occasion. ""The PLA has the confidence and capability to defeat all invading enemies and safeguard China's national sovereignty, security and development interests,"" Xi said as he inspected troops, armored vehicles, missiles and aircraft, hailing each formation by shouting ""Comrades, you've worked hard!"" ""We need to build a strong people's military more than any other time in history,"" Xi said, who served briefly in the military as an aide to the defense minister and last year assumed the title of commander in chief of the military's Joint Operations Command Center, whose insignia he wore on the camouflage battle dress. The forces addressed him as ""Chairman Xi"" as they rumbled past. The parade was blanketed by state media coverage and streamed for foreign audiences on YouTube, which is blocked inside China. On display were advanced weaponry including a new Dongfeng-31AG variant of the nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile and the Dongfeng-21D ""carrier killer."" Several H-6K bombers, the long-range aircraft recently involved in exercises near Japan and the South China Sea, were shown flying by overhead. Xi has emphasized combat readiness for the PLA - long criticized as a corrupt bureaucracy with scant combat experience - and pushed for an ambitious modernization program to make it a leaner force capable of projecting power overseas. Xi ordered 300,000 troops cut from the world's largest standing army two years ago while overseeing investments in aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines and stealth fighters with the goal of surpassing the United States in regional and even global influence. Although China has framed its growing military as a force for stability and peace, its expanding footprint and assertive posture in contested regions like the South and the East China Seas have worried neighboring nations and U.S. allies in the Pacific. Xi has been similarly emboldened on the domestic front as he took on powerful figures within the influential military establishment. He ordered anti-corruption campaigns that took down top-ranking generals and creating new battle theaters that placed trusted officers in command and shunted aside others. To reinforce his political position, Xi has extracted televised vows of loyalty from top generals while holding frequent events to show his affinity and support for the military, including a troop inspection in Hong Kong in June and a ceremony to present citations to 10 officers last week. Reinforcing the propaganda value of his appearance at the review, extensive footage of the event was broadcast at the top of every hour Monday by state broadcaster CCTV. On Sunday, Xi issued another call for loyalty as he instructed his amassed 12,000 troops to ""unswervingly stick to the fundamental principle and system of the party's absolute leadership over the army,"" the official Xinhua News Agency reported. ""Always listen to and follow the party's orders,"" Xi said. ""And march to wherever the party points to.""

21,Xi tells Infantino China wants to host World Cup,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4605968/Xi-tells-Infantino-China-wants-host-World-Cup.html," 05:20 BST, 15 June 2017 "," BEIJING, June 15 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping told FIFA boss Gianni Infantino he hoped the Asian nation could host a World Cup ""in the future"", the world soccer governing body said on Wednesday, after the two met in Beijing. Xi, an avid soccer fan, has launched an ambitious drive to improve Chinese football from the ground up and spoken of his wish for the country to qualify for another World Cup, host the tournament and eventually win it. China has invested heavily in the sport in recent years, boosting its domestic league by signing a number of high-profile, international players and coaches. In a statement released late on Wednesday, FIFA said Xi and president Infantino's meeting centred on soccer's popularity in China and the government's commitment to improving access to the game. ""In addition, the Chinese President expressed his hope, and the dream of many Chinese people, that the country would have the opportunity to host a FIFA Men´s World Cup at some stage in the future,"" it said. Chinese state media outlets, which are tightly controlled by the government and especially so when reporting the official activities of senior Communist Party leaders, did not report Xi's World Cup comment. Nevertheless, speculation has grown that China wishes to launch a bid for either the 2030 or 2034 tournaments. China's 82nd-ranked national team has qualified only once for the World Cup, losing all three matches and failing to score a goal in the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. Their failure to return to the finals has long frustrated local soccer fans. China are all but certain to miss out on qualifying for next year's tournament in Russia after a late goal by Syria in their 2-2 draw on Tuesday. ""There is still a very large disparity in the general standard of China's football today compared to major footballing nations,"" state broadcaster CCTV quoted Xi as saying in his meeting with Infantino. ""The true meaning of football is not just about competition, it is more about cultivating people's patriotism and collective fighting spirit."" China's growing influence within FIFA was reflected in the election of Zhang Jian to the governing body's executive Council in May, and FIFA has appointed a number of Chinese companies as sponsors for the World Cups in Russia and in Qatar in 2022. ""Today marks the kick-off of a new and closer cooperation between China and FIFA for the future of football,"" Infantino said in the FIFA statement.

22,Xi gets second term with powerful ally as VP,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5512115/Xi-gets-second-term-powerful-ally-VP.html," 03:07 BST, 17 March 2018 ","          China's President Xi Jinping received a standing ovation after winning all 2,970 votes at the National People's Congress  China's rubber-stamp parliament unanimously handed President Xi Jinping a second term Saturday and elevated his right-hand man to the vice presidency, giving him a strong ally to consolidate power and handle US trade threats. Xi's reappointment by the Communist Party-controlled legislature was a foregone conclusion, but all eyes had been on whether his former anti-corruption enforcer, Wang Qishan, would become his deputy. The National People's Congress has widely expanded Xi's already considerable authority during its annual session, adding his name to the constitution and lifting the two five-year term limit for the presidency and vice presidency. Xi received a standing ovation after winning all 2,970 votes for the presidency and Central Military Commission chairman. In 2013, Xi had received 2,952 votes, with one against and three abstentions, a 99.86 percent share. Only one delegate voted against Wang's appointment, with 2,969 in favour. Xi and Wang shook hands as the legislators heaped on applause. As part of the package of constitutional amendments, Xi and Wang for the first time took the oath of office by pledging allegiance to the constitution. Xi put his left hand on a red-covered book containing the charter, and raised his right fist to take his vow. ""I pledge loyalty to the constitution of the People's Republic of China"" Xi recited, vowing to ""strenuously struggle to build a rich, strong, democratic and civilised"" country. Elevating Wang allows Xi to keep a formidable ally by his side, as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong cements his authority and sets his sights on a possible lifelong tenure -- a move that has drawn criticism online. Wang, 69, stepped down from the Communist Party's ruling council in October under informal retirement rules. But he has kept a prominent profile, sitting at the same table as the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee during the public sessions of the National People's Congress while receiving fervent applause from the delegates as he voted. Wang's appointment shows that ""he's a really important political advisor,"" said Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King's College London. ""He's a very capable politician, so it makes sense he would still be around,"" Brown told AFP, noting that ""it also shows we're in an unconventional time in Chinese politics."" Wang was at the frontline of Xi's anti-corruption crusade, heading the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which has punished 1.5 million officials in the past five years, from low-level cadres to regional leaders and generals. He stepped down last year. Known internationally in his previous role as China's pointman on trade, Wang could help Xi deal with increasingly tense relations with the United States amid fears of a looming trade war, analysts say. - 'Dream team' - Xi's real power stems from his title as general secretary of the Communist Party, but analysts say Wang could provide extra heft to his presidency, even though the vice president has largely been a ceremonial post in the past. Xi is keeping Wang by his side because of his ""talent and ability,"" according to Hua Po, an independent Chinese political commentator. ""Choosing Wang as vice president is certainly to consolidate his power,"" Hua told AFP. ""Xi is already a very powerful man. The problem is that he has too few people who are loyal and competent for his use, so he has to retain Wang and give himself more time to cultivate more talented people."" Wang replaces Li Yuanchao, a relatively low-profile politician who has represented Xi on trips abroad. In his former position as vice premier, Wang periodically travelled to the United States, where then-president Barack Obama once gave the Chinese delegation a signed basketball. An ""amazing"" economist, he could now form a ""dream team"" with another member of the party leadership, Wang Yang, to deal with concerns that US President Donald Trump policies will trigger a trade war, Brown said. ""Maybe they'll be able to come up with a solution for this massive brewing storm with America about imbalances and tariffs."" - Great happiness - China's capital was engulfed in a rare flurry of swirling snow on Saturday, sending delegates of the congress scurrying from the Great Hall of the People after the vote. Legislators beamed when talking about Xi -- a stark contrast from the criticism that Chinese people expressed online when term limits were lifted last week, prompting censors into action. ""Our Chairman Xi is too great, truly he is too great,"" said Du Meishuang, a Chinese opera singer and delegate from Chairman Mao's home province of Hunan. ""I hope he will rule for life, truly, this is the common people's heartfelt wish."" She said the single vote against his deputy Wang was not a problem: ""His age is quite advanced, maybe that was the reason."" ""All Chinese are looking forward"" to Xi continuing on, said Zhang Fanhua, a delegate from Anhui, as he hurried into the falling snow. ""This is a great happiness for the country and the nation."""
23,China widens personality cult around 'unrivaled helmsman' Xi,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5106071/China-widens-personality-cult-unrivaled-helmsman-Xi.html," 00:40 BST, 22 November 2017 "," BEIJING (AP) - The village where he labored as a teen has become a shrine, a tree he planted an icon. State media applaud him endlessly, private businessmen praise his speeches and universities are devoting new departments to his theories. At the start of his second five-year term as leader of China's ruling Communist Party, Xi Jinping is at the center of China's most colorful efforts to build a cult of personality since the death of the founder of the People's Republic, Mao Zedong, in 1976. Efforts range from the trivial to the borderline hysterical, such as when state broadcaster China Central Television led its evening national news bulletin Friday with more than four minutes of uninterrupted clapping for Xi as he met with adoring citizens.          In this Nov. 3, 2013, photo released by Xinhua News Agency, Chinese President Xi Jinping, center, talks with local villagers and cadres at Shibadong village in Paibi Township of Huayuan County in the Tujia-Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Xiangxi in central China's Hunan Province. At the start of his second five-year term as leader of China's ruling Communist Party, Xi is at the center of China's most colorful efforts to build a cult of personality since the death of the founder of the People's Republic, Mao Zedong, in 1976. (Wang Ye/Xinhua via AP)  ""I am a servant of the people,"" Xi is described as telling an illiterate villager in a profile Friday by the official Xinhua News Agency that ran several thousand words and also hailed him as an ""unrivaled helmsman."" It said Xi led over 60 million people out of poverty in his first term, a statistic repeated ad nauseam in state media. A Russian translator was so engrossed with reading a recent speech by Xi, Xinhua said, that he skipped lunch and dinner just to finish studying it. ""We're now in a new round of the god-creation movement, similar to the Mao era,"" said Zhang Lifan, a Beijing-based political commentator. But access to the internet and other information sources undermines the party's efforts, resulting in mostly hollow proclamations intended to show loyalty at a time when dissent has serious consequences, he added. ""During the Mao era, many people believed in Mao from the bottom of their hearts,"" Zhang said. ""But now, this is mainly for effect, to show the leaders their loyalty and protect themselves. It is more of a performance."" President Donald Trump's Beijing visit this month also offered an opportunity to cast Xi as a leader of global standing representing an ancient culture reclaiming its place at the top table. Xi and his glamorous songstress wife, Peng Liyuan, hosted the first couple at the ancient Forbidden City palace complex as part of what China described as a ""state visit-plus,"" topped by the signing of a quarter-trillion dollars in economic arrangements. Xi's reappointment as Communist Party general secretary at last month's twice-a-decade party congress represented an apotheosis of sorts. He was written into the party constitution alongside Mao and Deng Xiaoping, who launched economic reforms in 1979 - cementing his status as China's most powerful leader since Mao. Provincial officials wasted no time finding creative ways to hail his leadership. A group visited a paulownia, or empress, tree planted by Xi eight years ago in Henan province's Lankao county. ""Like a bright red flag, it instructs the masses of party members to not forget the mission, to stay the path and forge ahead,"" a local news report said. Some Chinese provincial news outlets have even begun pushing the margins of state-sanctioned praise by bestowing additional accolades on Xi: A newspaper in the southern province of Guizhou referred to the president as ""The Great Leader Xi Jinping,"" in another throwback to the Mao era. Many of China's wealthiest tycoons and private conglomerates have also chimed in with praise. Wang Jianlin, head of real estate and leisure conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, was quoted by a Beijing newspaper as saying that he was ""overwhelmed by emotions"" listening to Xi's speech at the party congress. Chen Feng, co-founder and Communist Party secretary of HNA Group, a private airline and real estate conglomerate, led a recent gathering of thousands of employees in celebrating Xi and the party's leadership. ""The most important and crucial reason for achieving world-renowned achievements is that our party has at its core General Secretary Xi Jinping,"" Chen said. HNA Group has drawn scrutiny over a series of eye-catching global acquisitions and for its murky ownership structure. The government of Zhejiang province, where Xi served as party secretary for five years, has launched a public outreach campaign called ""What's My Favorite Xi Jinping Quote,"" arousing memories of Mao and his ""Little Red Book"" of revolutionary quotations. The Zhejiang village of Yedian has renamed its cultural center the ""Xi Language Hall of Honor,"" boasting a permanent exhibition of his speeches and writings along with a pictorial representation of the ""China Dream,"" a central motif of Xi's first term in office that envisions growing national prosperity and global clout. Xi's personality cult stems from his family background as the son of one of Mao's comrades in arms, Xi Zhongxun, who rose to the position of vice premier and was admired among the party faithful. During his teens and early 20s, however, when his father was purged by Mao, Xi spent six years as a ""sent down youth"" living in a cave and doing hard labor in Shaanxi province. Today, the village in which he worked, Liangjiahe, has become a place of pilgrimage for party members. Such reverence is not unusual within China's political culture, which has long placed special importance on places of significance to the lives of its leaders and the revolution they led. Xi's true popularity is impossible to determine due to the absence of objective polling data. But the domination of his image in official propaganda evokes, for some, the painful memories of the upheaval of the 1960s and '70s, when Mao was accorded the status of a near deity. ""The cult of personality did great harm to the Chinese nation. Many people retain deep lessons from it,"" said Hu Xingdou, a Beijing-based political commentator. Not to be left out, universities and colleges across the country have established research centers for ""Xi Jinping Thought."" Such moves are driven more by competition for research funding than genuine regard for Xi's political consciousness, said Hu. Yet, they still pose a danger in promoting vested interests above society as a whole, he said. ""If going forward this is for only personal interests or the interests of certain groups, then this kind of personality cult is meaningless and harmful,"" Hu said. ___ Associated Press researcher Shanshan Wang contributed to this report.

A woman carries a bag of groceries as she walks past a Chinese government billboard stating ""China Dream"" near a residential building in Beijing, on Thursday, Feb. 26, 2015.

The most famous of these has been the Chinese Dream, a fuzzy concept that seeks to motivate the nation¿s 1.3 billion people to realize prosperity, happiness and their rightful place on the world stage. (AP Photo/Andy Wong) The most famous has been the Chinese Dream, a fuzzy concept that seeks to motivate the nation's 1.3 billion people to realize prosperity, happiness and their rightful place on the world stage.Modernization has diluted the impact of such slogans, but Xi hopes his will aid in his rapid consolidation of power that's already made him the most prominent Chinese leader in a quarter-century.""Diminishing control over people's lives is an inevitable trend, but Xi is still making tremendous efforts to remain relevant by building his image,"" said Joseph Cheng, a Chinese politics expert at the City University of Hong Kong.The Four Comprehensives, mentioned by Xi in a speech late last year but trumpeted in state media on Wednesday and Thursday, are essentially a repackaging of goals and concepts laid out by Xi's predecessors. They comprise ""comprehensively"" establishing a moderately prosperous society, deepening reform, ruling the nation by law, and strictly enforcing party discipline.Such political shorthand is deeply rooted in Chinese political life, preceding even the establishment of the communist state in 1949. Among the most famous was Deng Xiaoping's ""Four Modernizations"" that sought to drag the country out of the mire of orthodox Communism.Successor Jiang Zemin sought to make his mark with the ""Three Represents,"" seen as an invitation to tycoons to join the party that traditionally favored workers, peasants and soldiers.Xi is establishing himself as a far stronger leader than either Jiang or Jiang's successor Hu Jintao, among whose least memorable catchphrases was the ""Eight Dos and Eight Don'ts,"" that sought to guide the behavior of good party members.To do so, Xi needs to seize the authority to define the political discourse and lay out his major concerns and policy directions, said City University's Cheng. ""He certainly wants to show that this is the Xi era, with a different approach,"" Cheng said.The party has a vast array of tools to disseminate such propaganda, especially state media that can package them as entertainment. The Chinese Dream phrase tripped off the hosts' tongues frequently during this year's Lunar New Year gala on state broadcaster CCTV.Next week's convening of the national legislature's annual session offers a further opportunity to embed Xi's slogans in the national consciousness, through speeches, discussion groups and banners displayed in the Great Hall of the People.The launch of the ""Four Comprehensives"" sets a clear direction for reform and signals that discussions on the matter have closed, said Ren Jin, professor of law, Chinese Academy of Governance in Beijing.""It shows that the year 2015 is the key year for comprehensively deepening reforms, as well as the beginning year for comprehensively exercising rule of law,"" Ren said.

25,China's Xi looks to extend power at Communist Party congress,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4987150/Chinas-Xi-looks-extend-power-Communist-Party-congress.html," 02:29 BST, 17 October 2017 "," BEIJING (AP) - Having bested his rivals, Chinese President Xi Jinping is primed to consolidate his already considerable power as the ruling Communist Party begins its twice-a-decade national congress on Wednesday. From meetings largely cloaked in secrecy, powerful players will emerge publicly in new roles, and Xi will address the nation to lay out his political and economic vision for the world's second-largest economy over the next five years. Villages will broadcast news of the congress over loudspeakers, a security crackdown has been extended and monitoring of dissidents strengthened. Xi, who is expected to get a second five-year term as party leader at the gathering, will kick off events with an address indicating whether his personal political theory will be entered into the party constitution alongside those of predecessors such as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. The honor was bestowed much later in office for most other leaders.          A visitor poses near a photo of Chinese President Xi Jinping at an exhibition highlighting China's achievements under five years of Xi's leadership at the Beijing Exhibition Hall in Beijing, China, Tuesday, Oct. 17, 2017. Having bested his rivals, Chinese President Xi Jinping is primed to consolidate his already considerable power as the ruling Communist Party begins its twice-a-decade national congress on Wednesday.(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)  Such a proclamation, at this time, would broadcast that Xi, already China's most powerful leader in decades, will continue to dominate Chinese politics for the next five years - and possibly more - with virtually no domestic opposition. Party congress spokesman Tuo Zhen on Tuesday said the party would continue structural reforms but ruled out any adoption of a multiparty democratic system. ""Political structural reform is not something that can be achieved overnight. China will not blindly copy or replicate the models of other countries,"" Tuo told reporters at a news conference to discuss the congress' agenda. Xi, in his speech, is also expected to recommit the party to achieving the goals of a ""moderately well-off society"" by 2021 - the 100th anniversary of the party's founding - and even greater national power and prosperity by 2049 - the centenary of the founding of the Communist state. Those achievements will depend on continued economic growth and the lifting of millions out of poverty, alongside the continued rapid expansion of Chinese military and political power, including its growing ability to dominate the Asia-Pacific region. The meeting's immediate results, however, will be personnel appointments, rumors about which have swirled for months. China is run by the party's Politburo Standing Committee, currently a seven-member body led by Xi, with Premier Li Keqiang his No. 2. Its size and composition have varied greatly over the years, although membership is generally restricted to the heads of state and party, the premier, the leader of the rubber-stamp parliament and officials in charge of propaganda, party discipline and other key sectors. While Xi and Li are expected to stay, the fates of others are determined by loosely defined precedents governing retirement age. Four are expected to depart, while the status of party discipline boss and close Xi ally Wang Qishan appears to be in flux. If Xi changes the rules or ignores precedents, such as that of the informal retirement age, he could risk a backlash inside the party from those who see respecting such norms as essential for a peaceful transfer of power. Observers will also be looking for a potential successor to Xi after his traditional second five-year term as party leader. While the nation's presidency is limited to two five-year terms, the office of party general secretary is bound by no such restrictions. Xi, 64, could step aside for a younger leader while maintaining ultimate control from behind the scenes. Whatever the outcome, most analysts say Xi has largely completed the task of sidelining his competitors in other cliques, including those surrounding his immediate predecessor, Hu Jintao, and former leader Jiang Zemin. ""Xi has been extremely successful in purging political rivals,"" said Feng Chongyi, an expert on Chinese politics at Sydney's University of Technology. ""There will be only one faction left after the 19th congress."" The 2,287 carefully hand-picked delegates to the congress are drawn from 40 constituencies, including the 31 provincial-level administrative districts, the government, the military, state industries and grass-roots organizations representing most of the party's 89 million members. In a secret process, they will select a roughly 200-member Central Committee, along with more than 150 alternates, from a pool of around 400 candidates. The committee will then pick a 25-member Politburo and the elite Politburo Standing Committee, led by the general secretary. The makeup of the top body will only be known at the close of the weeklong meeting when its members reveal themselves on stage in front of journalists, according to past practice. This year's congress is expected to usher in many new faces. Cheng Li, who studies Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, puts the turnover rate in the Central Committee at 70 percent, the highest since the peak of Mao's chaotic Cultural Revolution in 1969. However, women continue to be underrepresented in the top bodies, pointing to the abiding highly masculine tone of Chinese politics. No woman has ever served on the Politburo Standing Committee and only two currently are on the Politburo. Just 10 are on the Central Committee, comprising 4.9 percent of members. Extraordinary security measures are being imposed for the congress, and not just near the gathering. Already heavily restricted, access to foreign websites, social media platforms and messaging programs such as WhatsApp has been tightened and dissidents placed under increased scrutiny. In Beijing, thousands of deputized citizens patrol the streets, and knife, fireworks and chemical sales have been suspended. In the restive far-northwestern region of Xinjiang, police have demanded that owners of any knives longer than 10 centimeters (4 inches) have them embossed with a QR code for identification. And while many Chinese may seem blase, news about the congress is impossible to avoid. Villages are revving up decades-old public address systems to broadcast developments. They aim to cut through ""noise from the internet that left some beneficial policies misunderstood,"" the official Xinhua News Agency reported. The speaker systems, Xinhua says, can ""bring the CPC and Chinese people together better."" ___ This story has been corrected to fix spelling of spokesman's name to Tuo Zhen instead of Guo Zheng.

26,Xi says China will never permit loss of 'any piece' of land,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4749088/Xi-says-China-never-permit-loss-piece-land.html," 08:44 BST, 1 August 2017 "," BEIJING (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a tough line on national sovereignty Tuesday amid multiple territorial disputes with his country's neighbors, saying China will never permit the loss of ""any piece"" of its land to outsiders. Xi's declaration came during a nearly one-hour speech in Beijing marking the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, which has formed a key pillar of support for the ruling Communist Party since 1927 and is the world's largest standing military, with 2.3 million members. ""The Chinese people treasure peace and we absolutely do not engage in invasion and expansion. However, we have the confidence to conquer all forms of invasion,"" Xi told government leaders and current and retired PLA members gathered at the hulking Great Hall of the People, the seat of the legislature that sits beside Tiananmen Square.          Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks during a ceremony to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2017. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, Pool)  ""We absolutely will not permit any person, any organization, any political party - at any time, in any form - to separate any piece of Chinese territory from China,"" Xi said to applause. ""No one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit of damage to our sovereignty, security and development interests."" Xi made no reference to any specific conflicts or disputes during his address, which focused largely on the PLA's growth from a scrappy guerrilla force fighting Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and Japanese invaders into one of the world's most powerful, if largely untested, militaries. However, China is currently engaged in a weeks-long border standoff with Indian forces near the countries' disputed border high in the Himalayas, with Chinese spokesmen demanding that Indian troops withdraw to avoid a clash potentially worse than the brief but bloody war the two fought in the region in 1962. China has also long been embroiled in a contest with Japan over East China Sea islands, as well as with five other governments over competing claims to territory in the strategically vital South China Sea. Beijing also threatens to use force to conquer Taiwan if peaceful enticements prove insufficient. China considers the self-governing democratic island Chinese territory. In his speech, Xi also emphasized that the military's highest loyalty is to the ruling Communist Party, underscoring the PLA's key role as regime preserver through crises such as the bloody suppression of 1989 pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square. Top Chinese leaders have consistently rejected calls to make the PLA loyal to the government and people instead. ""The people's army will resolutely safeguard the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our country's socialist system, resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and resolutely safeguard regional and world peace,"" Xi said. The speech followed a parade Sunday at a training ground on the edge of the Gobi Desert during which Xi donned fatigues and declared that the military has the ""confidence and capability"" to ensure China's sovereignty, security and national interests. Xi, who commands the PLA as chairman of the Central Military Commission, has frequently spoken of his ""China Dream"" to restore China to a leadership position in international affairs with a modern, far-reaching military force to match. The parade at the Zhurihe base in Inner Mongolia featured troops and advanced weaponry, and was another forceful indication of Xi's iron grip over the PLA and every other political power base within the party ahead of a pivotal congress this autumn that will award him a second five-year term as leader. That followed similarly high-profile military reviews in Beijing in 2015 and Hong Kong in June. Last week, Xi bestowed newly created ""Aug. 1"" honors on servicemen in a further elevation of the armed forces' stature. Xi and his predecessors engineered a radical upgrading of the PLA's capabilities through years of double-digit percentage increases in the defense budget, making China the world's second-largest military spender after the United States, although growth has slowed alongside a cooling of the overall economy. That has also spurred a global role for the PLA, which was formerly overwhelmingly preoccupied with securing China's territorial integrity. Alongside its blue-water navy, China is building its first overseas military base in the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti, and Chinese ships held drills last month with Russia's navy in the Baltic Sea, more than 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) from their home ports.

27,Empowered Xi says China ready to fight 'bloody battle',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5522611/Empowered-Xi-says-China-ready-fight-bloody-battle.html," 12:32 BST, 20 March 2018 ","          President Xi Jinping is now China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong  President Xi Jinping delivered a blistering nationalist speech Tuesday, warning against any attempts to split China and touting the country's readiness to fight ""the bloody battle"" to regain its rightful place in the world. Xi's address capped an annual session of the National People's Congress that paved the way for him to rule for life, as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong pushes through his vision of guiding the country through a ""new era"" of unrivalled global military and economic supremacy. Days after President Donald Trump signed new rules allowing top-level US officials to travel to Taiwan, Xi warned that Beijing would defend its ""one China principle"", which sees the self-ruled island as its territory awaiting reunification. ""All acts and tricks to separate the country are doomed to fail and will be condemned by the people and punished by history,"" Xi told nearly 3,000 delegates assembled at the imposing Great Hall of the People facing Tiananmen Square. Taiwan in response urged China to shelve its mindset of ""forceful intimidation"" and pursue a breakthrough in cross-strait relations. The island's Mainland Affairs Council in a statement accused Beijing of intensifying ""propaganda measures to lure away Taiwan's talent, funds and technology for its own economic development"". Xi also sought to address concerns about ambitious Chinese development projects abroad, saying they ""will not pose a threat to any country."" ""Only those who are accustomed to threatening others will see everyone as a threat,"" he added in an address that drew waves of applause from the legislators. China is overseeing a massive global trade infrastructure initiative to revive the ancient Silk Road, drawing interest from nations participating in the investment but also criticism from others fearing that it mainly serves Beijing's interests.          No caption  The Chinese leader's plan to build a ""world-class"" military by mid-century has also raised concerns about how it plans to use its increasingly modern forces amid regional frictions over China's territorial claims in the South China Sea. Xi used the speech to espouse his vision of realising the ""rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"" -- the ""greatest dream"" of the world's second-largest economy. ""The Chinese people have been indomitable and persistent, we have the spirit of fighting the bloody battle against our enemies to the bitter end,"" he said. But his speech was also a reminder that the Communist Party, more than ever, reigns over the country's affairs. ""History has already proven and will continue to prove that only socialism can save China,"" he said. ""The Communist Party is the supreme political leadership of the country and the fundamental guarantee to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" - Indefinite rule - The two-week session of the National People's Congress handed Xi, 64, a second term and endorsed the Communist Party's decision to lift presidential term limits, clearing the way for him to remain in power indefinitely after his new term ends in 2023.          China's rubber-stamp parliament cleared the way for Xi Jinping to remain in power indefinitely  His eponymous political philosophy, which was enshrined in the party charter last year, was added to the national constitution and senior government officials had to swear an oath to the document for the first time. Some of Xi's key lieutenants were also promoted to top positions. His former anti-corruption czar Wang Qishan was elevated to the vice presidency while his top economic adviser Liu He became a vice premier. Wang could use his experience as a trade negotiator to deal with rocky relations with the Trump administration, while Liu is expected to have an influential role in economic policymaking. Trump is considering new punitive measures against China over its ""theft"" of US intellectual property, raising fears of a trade war. ""We hope that both parties can maintain reason, not act emotionally, and avoid a trade war,"" Premier Li Keqiang told a press conference after Xi's speech. On the domestic front, the legislature approved the biggest government shake-up in years, merging the banking and insurance regulators to tackle financial risks, and amended the constitution to expand the Communist Party's role in the country's affairs. Xi's campaign against corruption within the party, which punished 1.5 million officials in five years, was expanded as the legislature voted Tuesday to create a national agency that will scrutinise millions of public servants. ""The Communist Party of China must... resolutely eliminate"" corruption, Xi said.          President Xi Jinping's speech was delivered at the closing session of the annual National People's Congress  The government's propaganda machine worked in overdrive to nurture a cult of personality around Xi and stamp out dissenting views during the two-week session. The People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, referred to Xi as the ""helmsman"" last weekend, an echo of Mao who was known as ""the great helmsman"". The abolition of term limits triggered a rare bout of criticism on social media, prompting censors to block dozens of phrases. China has stepped up its crackdown on civil society since Xi took power in 2012."
28,"No term limit could allow Xi to be bold on Hong Kong, Taiwan",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5493187/No-terms-limits-Xi-sway-Hong-Kong-Taiwan.html," 00:40 BST, 13 March 2018 "," BEIJING (AP) - China's move to scrap term limits and allow Xi Jinping to serve as president indefinitely puts him on track to deal with some of the country's weightiest long-term sovereignty challenges, especially the fates of Hong Kong and Taiwan. The question is, will Xi bet big on bold moves that could result in potentially disastrous consequences? Hong Kong offers a delicate initial test. Since passing from British to Chinese rule in 1997, the financial hub has operated as a ""special administrative region,"" retaining its own legal and economic system and enjoying a considerable degree of autonomy from Beijing.

China's move to scrap term limits and allow Xi Jinping to serve as president indefinitely puts him on track to deal with some of the country's weightiest long-term sovereignty challenges, especially the fates of Hong Kong and Taiwan. (Xie Huanchi/Xinhua via AP, File)  That arrangement was supposed to last 50 years, until 2047, but calls for political reform in the city and what many see as Beijing tightening its controls and encroaching on freedoms there have created rising tensions. Earlier this month, a member of the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee delivered a stern warning to Hong Kong delegates to China's rubber-stamp parliament over the central government's limits of tolerance. ""Using the high degree of autonomy to reject, fight and erode the central government's comprehensive jurisdiction is absolutely not allowed,"" Zhao Leji told members of the National People's Congress, which passed a constitutional amendment Sunday abolishing presidential term limits, opening the door for Xi to rule for as long as he wants. Hong Kong activists had already been set on edge by the disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers from the city's Legislative Council and the apparent abduction by Chinese security forces of several men who published salacious tomes about China's leadership. Still, Hong Kong remains one of the world's freest economies and a window to the outside for the Chinese financial system, which operates under much tighter restrictions. The cosmopolitan city of 6 million, with its vibrant tourism, arts and education sectors, also remains a beacon to many aspiring Chinese. ""I don't think bold action is necessary with respect to Hong Kong,"" said Michael Mazza of the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington, D.C. Xi is ""already well along in the process of turning (Hong Kong) into just another Chinese city,"" he said. Self-governing Taiwan, however, is quite a different story, posing a direct challenge to the Communist Party's claim as the representative of all Chinese and guardian of Chinese sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Since splitting from the mainland amid civil war in 1949, the former Japanese colony has evolved into a wealthy, vibrant democracy whose 23 million people take an increasingly dim view of any form of political integration with Beijing. By casting himself as a leader of historic standing, Xi has assumed the mantle of unifier and may regard failure in this regard as a stain on his reputation. In his most direct comments on the issue, he told a Taiwanese envoy in 2013 that a final resolution was required, and that what he regards as the ""sacred mission"" of unification ""cannot be passed on from generation to generation."" ""Action on Taiwan is certainly possible. Unification is a key aspect of Xi Jinping's goal of 'national rejuvenation,' necessary for achieving the 'China Dream,'"" Mazza said, referencing two of Xi's chief goals. Xi ""may conclude that peaceful unification is not in the cards any time soon, leaving him to rely on coercion or outright force to achieve his goals,"" he said. Already, China over the past two years has been ratcheting up political, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan's independence-leaning president, Tsai Ing-wen. A military attack, however, could quickly draw in the U.S., which is legally bound to respond to threats against the island. Yet the risks of an attack on Taiwan remain prohibitively high, to the point of threatening regime stability in China, due in no small part to its embrace by the U.S. and Japan, said Miles Yu Maochun, a China politics expert at the U.S. Naval Academy. Hong Kong, meanwhile, remains too valuable to Beijing in its present form to risk upsetting, he said. Xi views Taiwan and Hong Kong as equally important to cementing his authority, said analyst Teng Biao, a visiting scholar at New York University's U.S.-Asia Law Institute. ""When he has strengthened his own power, he will show zero tolerance for Taiwan and Hong Kong independence, and even more threaten the use of force,"" Teng said. While it is broadly assumed that an increasingly dictatorial Xi will also grow more aggressive on the world stage, it's unclear how that will manifest itself. China says it is committed to seizing a group of uninhabited flyspeck islands in the East China Sea from Japan, but is also aware that such action would trigger the U.S.-Japan security alliance. And despite President Donald Trump's ""America first"" policy and his withdrawal of the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Washington and its armed forces show no sign of giving up the West Pacific to China. While Xi's position appears unassailable, domestic political risks remain that may prompt him to take an even harder line at home and abroad, said Teng, who was detained by Xi's regime while working as a human rights lawyer. ""When the Communist Party faces political, economic and ideological challenges, and given the fact that the party firmly refuses a democratization, the only way seems to become more dictatorial and oppressive,"" Teng said.

Mr Xi continues to sit atop the new seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, five of whose members were newly appointedXi Jinping, 64, President of China, returning member Mr Xi is widely seen as China's most powerful leader since Chairman Mao Zedong. He is the son of Xi Zhongxun, a Communist revolutionary veteran and vice premier, and spent his teenage years living in a cave in the rural northern Shaanxi Province. Xi Zhongxun was removed from power, publicly humiliated and imprisoned during China's Cultural Revolution, a social-political movement in China between 1966 and 1976 which was set to punish anyone who could potentially challenge Mao's authority. Xi Jinping didn't see his father, who was sent to a factory to work, for seven years during the time. It's said that after the Cultural Revolution ended and when Xi Zhongxun was released back to his family, he couldn't even recognise his own son and had to ask Xi Jinping 'are you Jinping or are you Yuanping'.Xi Jinping was once viewed as a drab 'princeling' child of the elite. But since soaring to power in 2012, Xi has centralised authority under his own leadership with a signature anti-graft battle.His political theory - 'Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era' - was written into the Party constitution on Tuesday, making him the only Chinese leader to be named by the constitution during his term after Mao Zedong.

Pictured, Mr Li stands on stage during the unveiling of the Politburo Standing Committee in Beijing on October 25Li Keqiang, 62, Premier of China, returning memberBorn in eastern China's Anhui Province, Mr Li has a legal and economic background. He was sent to the farm to work during the Cultural Revolution. In 1978, he became one of the first university students to resume their studies after the Cultural Revolution. He was enrolled by the Peking University, one of China's best academic institutions. He started his policital career working as the Secretary of Youth League Committee at the Peking University in 1982. He was elected as the Premier of China in 2013. As the party's second-ranking official primarily responsible for overseeing the economy and leading the Cabinet, Mr Li is the only other returning member of the new Politburo.Mr Li's authority was widely viewed as having been undercut by Mr Xi's accumulation of power over all sectors of government, although his continuing presence on the committee appears to speak to the high-regard in which he is held within the party.Mr Li's policies have sought to spur entrepreneurship and innovation, but he has been increasingly overshadowed by Mr Xi, who has thrown his weight behind reforms to make state sector firms 'stronger, better and bigger' and to manage financial stability.Li Zhanshu, 67, Director of the party's General Office, new memberDescribed to be Xi Jinping's confidant, Mr Li is the eldest of all members at the new Politburo Standing Committee and an MBA.He worked his way up from Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, and graduated from Hebei Normal University. A former governor of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and one-time party boss of the southwestern province of Guizhou, Li Zhanshu is considered one of Xi's closest advisors and often accompanies him on overseas trips.

However, he backed down after drawing criticism from party conservatives.Wang Huning, 62, Director of the party's Central Policy Research Office, new memberMr Wang was a top policy researcher for the party under former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, a position he has kept under Xi as head of the Central Policy Research Office. He coined the 'Three Represents' and 'Scientific Outlook of Development' - respectively Jiang and Hu's contributions to party thought, as well as the 'Chinese Dream', Xi's own vision. Wang was formerly an academic at Shanghai's Fudan University, specialising first in international relations and then law. He is also considered one of Xi's closest advisors.               Zhao Leji (left) is the head of the Central Organisation Department responsible for job assignments who is expected to head the much-feared corruption watchdog body.

According to the clause 79 of the Constitution of China, the maximum number of terms that a President can service is two.This means Xi, who became the president in 2013, will have to retire from the position in 2022.However, Xi's other position, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, has no serving limit. This is also the highest position in the Communist Party of China.As the Communist Party is the ruling party and only major party of China, some believed that the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee is actually the most powerful position in China and suggested Xi could potentially extend his reign through it.  Today, Mr Xi was given a second term as the President of China and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee. He was also named the chairman of the Communist Party of China Central Military Commission.Yesterday, the party unanimously passed the amendment to include 'Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era' as one of its guiding principles at the end of its week-long congress.No other leader since Mao has had an eponymous ideology included in the Constitution of the Communist Party of China while in office until Mr Xi.Deng Xiaoping, widely considered as the father of China's economic reform, has also been named in the constitution, but his name was only added after his death in 1997.Mr Xi's more recent predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, both had the party constitution amended to include their guiding thoughts, but without their names directly attached.Media reports have suggested that Mr Xi has removed his key 'rivals' with his anti-corruption campaign in order to rule China for life.Yesterday's amendment to the party's constitution sparked more speculation that Mr Xi essentially has a mandate to lead for as long he wants.               No other leader since Mao Zedong (right) has had an eponymous ideology included in the Constitution of the Communist Party of China while in office until the current Chinese president Xi Jinping (left).

China's Politburo Standing Committee is a seven-member committee that holds the ultimate power.The committee is elected once every five years at the national congress and makes decisions on the most important issues regarding the country's future using a voting system.All members of the Politburo Standing Committee are hand-picked by the President from the 25-member Politburo- the second tier in Beijing's power structure.Apparently, there is an official ranking within the seven-member committee. The ranking is usually suggested by where the member stands in relation to the President when they meet the public - the closer the more senior.The members' roles are described to be the 'core' leaders of the Party and follow strict rules of the National Congress, Central Committee and the Politburo, as well as give guidance according the principle of democratic centralism.It's understood that the members will cast their votes in 'closed-door' meetings to determine the military, political, economic directions of the country. Source: People's Daily Online, Reuters, CNBC    Although China has time limit on how long a President could serve, there seems to be no limit on Mr Xi's other positions. According to the clause 79 of the Constitution of China, the maximum number of terms that a President can service is two, which means Xi, who became the president in 2013, will have to retire from the position in 2022.However, Xi's other position, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, has no serving limit. This is also the highest position in the Communist Party of China.As the Communist Party is the ruling party and only major party of China, some believed that the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee is actually the most powerful position in China and suggested Xi could potentially extend his reign through it.Mr Xi continues to sit atop the new seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, five of whose members were newly appointed. The make-up of the committee reflects Mr Xi's efforts to foster party unity by striking a balance between different interest groups in the 89-million member organisation as he seeks to better position a reinvigorated party to dominate China's affairs at home and abroad.They will assume responsibility for running the rubber-stamp legislature, the National People's Congress and its advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and assume a range of portfolios, including those responsible for propaganda, party discipline, ethnic and Taiwan affairs and science and technology. Mr Zhao is expected to head the much-feared corruption watchdog body, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.Mr Xi has made his wide-ranging anti-corruption campaign the hallmark of his first five years in office. While popular among ordinary Chinese, it is seen as part of a drive to purge his rivals and political opponents and boost supervision over the party at all levels.Alongside the campaign, Mr Xi has overseen one of the harshest crackdowns on civil society aimed at squelching dissent and activism among lawyers and rights advocates.The new leaders will face challenges that include reining burgeoning levels of debt seen as the biggest threat to economic stability and managing trade tensions with Washington and Europe over China's excess production of steel and other goods.          Chinese President Xi Jinping (left) shake hands China's former president Jiang Zemin (right) at the Chinese Communist Party's Congress on October 18.

30,AP PHOTOS: Banners herald China's Communist Party congress,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4987536/AP-PHOTOS-Banners-herald-Chinas-Communist-Party-congress.html," 07:09 BST, 17 October 2017 "," BEIJING (AP) - As China's ruling Communist Party kicks off its twice-a-decade national congress this week, buildings, bridges and construction sites around Beijing have been festooned with banners heralding the party's merits and its goal of realizing the ""Chinese Dream"" of greater prosperity. While the party routinely deploys television and the Internet to broadcast its message, it falls back on more traditional means for important occasions in hopes of boosting interest in political developments. The medium resonates especially with older Chinese who experienced the political campaigns of Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, which sought to mobilize the masses for economic and political ends. The modern banners feature golden yellow Chinese characters emblazoned on deep red backgrounds extolling the virtues of socialism and the future vision of the party's leader, President Xi Jinping, who will be granted a second five-year term as general secretary at the congress, which starts Wednesday.

Despite the propaganda push, however, most Beijing residents evince little interest in the banners and slogans, preferring to focus on jobs, family and the latest Internet trends.

31,The real reason China's leader jailed so many of his peers,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3249455/The-real-reason-Chinas-leader-jailed-peers.html," 20:14 BST, 25 September 2015 ","The real reason China's leader jailed so many of his peers By Reuters   Published: 20:14 BST, 25 September 2015  |  Updated: 20:14 BST, 25 September 2015                e-mail         By William JohnsonSept 25 (Reuters) - While speaking to tech leaders in Seattle on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping denied that his pursuit of corrupt officials was a ""House of Cards""-style power play.Although Xi has indeed taken out many senior leaders in the Communist Party and the Chinese military, he's doing so not to protect his own seat of power, but to deal with the threat that factionalism poses to the Party.When outsiders consider division within China's Communist Party, they generally focus on rivalry between the princelings (sons of leading Chinese revolutionaries) and the shopkeepers (party members with no direct link to the revolution). While this dynamic certainly exists, Xi's challenge is far greater.Four major groups pose threats to Xi's pursuit of his China Dream. They are the Communist Youth League group, led by Xi's predecessor, Hu Jintao; the Shanghai Gang, led by Jiang Zemin; the Shanxi Gang, led until his incarceration by Ling Jihua; and the People's Liberation Army. Each of these groups has been the target of Xi's anti-corruption efforts, as well as his efforts to steer the Chinese economy through a transition from an export-dominated economy to one driven by domestic consumption. In order to keep the country functioning, Xi needs to control these factions without giving any one of them too much power.The Communist Youth League (CYL) was Xi's first target. In defeating Li Keqiang, Hu Jintao's CYL protégé, Xi effectively marginalized Li, the most senior member of the CYL still in active service. Xi also wrested control of the Central Military Commission from Hu Jintao , rather than allowing Hu to retain control. This timing is in stark contrast to Hu's own ascension to power, when Jiang Zemin retained control of the military for two years after stepping down as chairman. Finally, only Li Keqiang remains to represent the CYL faction in the Politburo Standing Committee, outnumbered six to one in a Committee that had, up to Xi's rise, been relatively balanced.Xi then focused on demonstrating his independence from Jiang Zemin, which culminated in the successful prosecution of Zhou Yongkang, former head of the State Security apparatus and a close associate of Jiang. Zhou's prosecution led to some speculation that Jiang might be the next target, and certainly made clear that Xi would pursue his anti-corruption campaign to the highest levels. The prosecution left no doubt that, at least for the time being, both of Xi's predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, had been effectively marginalized.Next, Xi worked to consolidate his control over the People's Liberation Army (PLA).He began by targeting Xu Caihou, a retired general and Deputy Chairman of the Central Military Commission, which Xi chairs. The Central Military Commission charged Xu with corruption for accepting bribes and favors from both military underlings (in exchange for promotions), and cement companies (in exchange for government contracts). In an investigation that reportedly only lasted three months, Xi removed the most senior military member of the commission and sent a clear message that the PLA should focus on military competence rather than accumulation of wealth.Xi made another step to assert his power over the PLA by announcing, just a week after the military parade celebrating the anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War Two, that the PLA will reduce its forces by 300,000 troops - a cut that has not been well-received within the PLA.Xi has spent great effort reinforcing his position - and believes that strength is necessary to guide China through its economic transition. Without that strength, the Party may be doomed. As it stands, China and its Communist Party are likely to weather this storm as they have the ones that came before.There are good reasons to be concerned about China. But neither Xi, nor the Communist Party of China, is on its last legs. (William Johnson)"
32,"In mass address, China's Xi calls for total party loyalty",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-5258507/In-mass-address-Chinas-Xi-calls-total-party-loyalty.html," 12:46 BST, 11 January 2018 "," BEIJING, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping called on Thursday for out-and-out implementation of central party policy and the total loyalty of officials, the state broadcaster reported, in speech on discipline and corruption broadcast across the country. Over five years in office, Xi has accrued more power than any of his immediate predecessors and has waged a war on graft in the ruling Communist Party. He has also intensified efforts to ensure cadres are disciplined, upright and honest. Nevertheless, his latest call for unwavering discipline, delivered in a lengthy speech live-streamed to party officials around the country, was unusual in its bluntness. ""When the party centre makes a policy decision, all party groups must put it into practice to the letter,"" Xi said in the speech directed at the central party leadership, according to the CCTV state broadcaster. ""At any time and in any situation, the party's leading officials must stand firm and be trustworthy in their politics, be sincerely devoted to the party, be in one mind with the party centre,"" he said. Efforts in party building are a ""fundamental guarantee"" of finally achieving the Chinese dream, Xi said, referring to an aspiration to restore a rejuvenated China to its full standing globally. Officials who fail to carry out their political duty must be held accountable, Xi said. He also re-iterated that there would be no let-up in efforts to tackle deep-rooted graft within the party. ""As soon as a 'tiger' rears his head, we will strike at once; as soon as a 'fly' flies in disorder, we will swat,"" he said, referring to high- and low-level officials. China's top corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, said that 527,000 people were disciplined for graft in 2017, with 58 being high-level cadres, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

Since taking office President Xi has sought to increase his authority over the People's Liberation Army, which is technically the armed force of the Communist Party rather than the Chinese state ©Kenzaburo Fukuhara (Pool/AFP/File) Since taking office Xi has sought to increase his authority over the People's Liberation Army, which is technically the armed force of the Communist Party rather than the Chinese state.Some of its top officers have been among those who have fallen in his much-publicised anti-corruption drive.The military should be ""absolutely loyal"", he said during his visit, the official news agency Xinhua reported.Under Xi, China has taken a more assertive foreign policy stance, rapidly building up artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea and regularly sailing vessels into waters around Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea, raising fears of clashes.The military should be ""resourceful in fighting, efficient in commanding and courageous and capable of winning wars"", Xi said.The joint command system should be efficient and active in both peace and war, Xinhua paraphrased him as adding.Xi donned fatigues for the visit, although his garb did not carry any rank insignia. He has generally worn a plain black or dark green uniform for formal military occasions such as a giant parade in Beijing last year.The command centre was established as part of a major reshuffle of China's military structure, which also included the creation of a Rocket Force to operate its missiles.When the changes were unveiled in January Xi described them as ""a major policy decision to realise the Chinese dream of a strong army"", state media reported.The military's four powerful headquarters –- general staff, political, logistics and armaments –- were reorganised into 15 agencies under the CMC, which Xi heads.New ""battle zones"" were also established to focus on combat and joint operation command systems, replacing the former ""military regions"" which had separate command structures and significant administrative responsibilities.Beijing has been building up its military for years, with regular double-digit increases in its official budget.It has invested in an expanded fleet of submarines and its first indigenous aircraft carrier, as it seeks to build a navy capable of projecting power abroad.Xi has announced plans to slash China's troop numbers by 300,000 to roughly two million to craft a more efficient fighting force.

There is no place for such a person to stand anywhere.'In contemporary China, the essence of patriotism is to combine one's love for the country with love for the party and socialism,' he said.  Xi is heard talking in footage released by China Global Television Network: 'The history has shown that as long as the Chinese people and the Chinese nation dare to sacrifice themselves and to change their destiny, our country will prosper, and our nation will realise the great rejuvenation.'          The May Fourth Movement was a landmark protest against colonialism and imperialism that rocked China in 1919 and led to the birth of the Communist Party of China two years later. The above picture shows the participants from Peking University         It was a nationalist movement that began when some 3,000 Peking University students marched to Tian'anmen Square         The protesters from 100 years ago were angry at the handing of German concessions in China to Japan during World War I  Xi Jinping: China's most powerful leader since Mao  Xi Jinping has been widely considered as China's most powerful leader since the nation's founding father Chairman Mao who ruled from 1949 to 1976.Xi could potentially rule China for life after Chinese lawmakers in March last year abolished presidential term limits that had been in place for more than 35 years.His ideology, formally known as Xi Jinping Thought, was also incorporated into China's Constitution to further solidify his power.Last year, Xi was named by Forbes as the most powerful person on Earth, ending Putin's four-year reign at the top and pushing Trump down to the third.  The May 4, 1919 protest was a nationalist movement that began when some 3,000 Peking University students marched to Tian'anmen Square in anger at the handing of German concessions in China to Japan at the end of World War I.The protests mushroomed into calls for a cultural and political awakening to modernise China.Other sensitive dates loom this year, including the 30th anniversary of the Tian'anmen protests on June 4, the 10th anniversary of riots in the restive Xinjiang region on July 5, and five years since the Hong Kong pro-democracy Umbrella Movement. While Xi has repeatedly extolled the teachings of Marx and the Communist Party, authorities have apparently cracked down on Marxist students who backed labour movements in recent months.Two sources close to a Marxist student group at elite Peking University told AFP Tuesday that they hadn't been able to contact five students for over 24 hours, raising concerns that they may have been detained by police for taking part in an activity to mark Labour Day.The group includes Qiu Zhanxuan, the school's former Marxist society president, who was detained by police in December and later forced to step down by college administration after attempting to commemorate the 125th birthday of Mao Zedong, whose legacy in China remains controversial.

Reuters reported last year that the department was targeting academics, students and leaders in self-ruled Taiwan in an attempt to soften opposition to China's ruling Communist Party and ultimately build support for unification.Since Xi took over as party chief in late 2012, he has repeatedly invoked nationalistic themes to win public legitimacy as he seeks to bolster China's image in the world. Analysts say Xi realises that one of the top challenges he faces is that China's soft power has lagged far behind its growing economic and military might.Xi has said he aims to turn China into a ""cyber power"", but he has also presided over an intensifying online crackdown that has drawn criticism from rights groups and dissidents at home and abroad.Xi's administration has waged a crackdown on online ""rumour-mongering"", which is widely seen as a tool to halt criticism of the party. The campaign has chilled political discourse, with high-profile bloggers saying they have reined in sensitive posts for fear of detention.Xi said students were the ""new focal point of the United Front"", saying they should go abroad but return to serve the country.""Today, the domestic economy is facing downward pressure,"" Xi said. ""Vigorously attracting outstanding overseas talent has become an urgent national requirement.""Xi said officials should cultivate the younger generation from the ""non-public economy"" - government-speak for the private sector.Xi called on officials to ""step up ideological and political work"" on intellectuals who do not belong to the Communist Party.

36,Christian heartland opens window into fight for China's soul,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6033937/Christian-heartland-opens-window-fight-Chinas-soul.html," 05:18 BST, 7 August 2018 "," NANYANG, China (AP) - The 62-year-old Chinese shopkeeper had waited nearly his entire adult life to see his dream of building a church come true - a brick house with a sunny courtyard and spacious hall with room for 200 believers. But in March, about a dozen police officers and local officials suddenly showed up at the church on his property and made the frightened congregants disperse. They ordered that the cross, a painting of the Last Supper and Bible verse calligraphy be taken down. And they demanded that all services stop until each person, along with the church itself, was registered with the government, said the shopkeeper, Guo. Without warning, Guo and his neighbors in China's Christian heartland province of Henan had found themselves on the front lines of an ambitious new effort by the officially atheist ruling Communist Party to dictate - and in some cases displace - the practice of faith in the country.          In this photo taken Monday, June 4, 2018, Chinese calligraphy which reads ""All nations belong to the Lord arising to shine"" at left and ""Jesus's salvation spreads to the whole world"" at right are displayed below a crucifix in a house church shut down by authorities near the city of Nanyang in central China's Henan province. Under President Xi Jinping, China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, believers are seeing their freedoms shrink dramatically even as the country undergoes a religious revival. Experts and activists say that as he consolidates his power, Xi is waging the most severe systematic suppression of Christianity in the country since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)  ""I've always prayed for our country's leaders, for our country to get stronger,"" said Guo, who gave only his last name out of fear of government retribution. ""They were never this severe before, not since I started going to church in the 80's. Why are they telling us to stop now?"" Under President Xi Jinping, China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, believers are seeing their freedoms shrink dramatically even as the country undergoes a religious revival. Experts and activists say that as he consolidates his power, Xi is waging the most severe systematic suppression of Christianity in the country since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982. The crackdown on Christianity is part of a broader push by Xi to ""Sinicize"" all the nation's religions by infusing them with ""Chinese characteristics"" such as loyalty to the Communist Party. Islamic crescents and domes have been stripped from mosques, and a campaign launched to ""re-educate"" tens of thousands of Uighur Muslims. Tibetan children have been moved from Buddhist temples to schools and banned from religious activities during their summer holidays, state-run media report. This spring, a five-year plan to ""Sinicize"" Christianity in particular was introduced, along with new rules on religious affairs. Over the last several months, local governments across the country have shut down hundreds of private Christian ""house churches."" A statement last week from 47 in Beijing alone said they had faced ""unprecedented"" harassment since February. Authorities have also seized Bibles, while major e-commerce retailers JD.com and Taobao pulled them off their sites. Children and party members are banned from churches in some areas, and at least one township has encouraged Christians to replace posters of Jesus with portraits of Xi. Some Christians have resorted to holding services in secret. A dozen Chinese Protestants interviewed by the Associated Press described gatherings that were raided, interrogations and surveillance, and one pastor said hundreds of his congregants were questioned individually about their faith. Like Guo, the majority requested that their names be partly or fully withheld because they feared punishment from authorities. After reporters visited Henan in June, some interviewees said they were contacted by police or local officials who urged them not to discuss any new measures around Christianity. The party has long been wary of Christianity because of its affiliation with Western political values. Several Chinese human rights lawyers jailed for their work, including Jiang Tianyong and Li Heping, are outspoken Christians. So too are many Hong Kong pro-democracy activists, not least among them 2014 protest leader Joshua Wong. ""Chinese leaders have always been suspicious of the political challenge or threat that Christianity poses to the Communist regime,"" said Xi Lian, a scholar of Christianity in China at Duke University. ""Under Xi, this fear of Western infiltration has intensified and gained a prominence that we haven't seen for a long time."" ___ Guo, who keeps a small storefront selling ornate doors in a riverside district, once had eyesight so poor that he could not distinguish the sky from the earth. But after finding God at 27 years old, he made a seemingly miraculous recovery that he attributes to his faith. For decades, he, like many Christians in China, shuttled from one unregistered house church to another, where folding chairs served as pews and coffee tables as lecterns. Two years ago, he and 10 other Christians pooled their money to erect a permanent church on his property. They are part of what experts describe as a spiritual awakening in China. The number of Chinese believers of all faiths has doubled in two decades to an estimated 200 million, by official count, as the hold of the Communist party has weakened. Among them are an estimated 67 million Christians, including Catholics - a number that is expected to swell to become the world's largest Christian population in a matter of decades. This rapid growth has reinvigorated the party's longtime mission to domesticate a religion traditionally aligned with the West. Historians believe that Christianity was known to China as early as the seventh century, and was later propagated by Jesuit missionaries starting in the 1500s. In recent decades the religion has faced by turns heavy persecution and tacit acceptance. During the Cultural Revolution, when Mao sought to eradicate all religions, Christians were jailed, tortured and publicly humiliated. But they survived by operating covertly and grew steadily in number after Mao's death in 1976, when a populace disillusioned with the Communist Party began to seek moral guidance elsewhere. Chinese Christians say the Bible gives them a sense of right versus wrong and the strength to endure in a country where power often trumps justice. While China's rapid growth has brought prosperity to many, others despair at what they see as a deterioration of public morals. The deaths of children in scandals involving tainted infant formula and shoddily-built schools in recent years have led to the sense that modern China was in the midst of an ethical crisis. ""After the 'collapse' of communist ideology, no value system has been in place to fill the spiritual vacuum,"" said writer Zhang Lijia. ""China has witnessed a religious revival in recent decades precisely because of this vacuum and relaxed control."" Officials once largely tolerated the unregistered Protestant house churches that sprang up independent of the official Christian Council, clamping down on some while allowing others to grow. But this year they have taken a tougher approach that relies partly on ""thought reform"" - a phrase for political indoctrination. Last November, Christian residents of a rural township in southeast Jiangxi province were persuaded to replace posters of the cross and Jesus Christ inside their homes with portraits of Xi, a local official said. ""Through our thought reform, they've voluntarily done it,"" Qi Yan, a member of the township party committee, told the AP by phone. ""The move is aimed at Christian families in poverty, and we educated them to believe in science and not in superstition, making them believe in the party."" The poster campaign appears to symbolize what analysts see as the underlying force driving the change in the party's approach to religion: the ascendance of Xi. ""Xi is a closet Maoist - he is very anxious about thought control,"" said Willy Lam, a Chinese politics expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""He definitely does not want people to be faithful members of the church, because then people would profess their allegiance to the church rather than to the party, or more exactly, to Xi himself."" Various state and local officials declined repeated requests to comment. But in 2016, Xi explicitly warned against the perceived foreign threats tied to faith, telling a religion conference: ""We must resolutely guard against overseas infiltrations via religious means."" And in April, the religious affairs department published an article saying that churches must endorse the party's leadership as part of ""Sinicization."" ""Only Sinicized churches can obtain God's love,"" the article stated. The state-backed Chinese Catholic church at recent conferences has also stressed the need to remain independent of the Vatican and to ""Sinicize"" itself. Along with ""thought reform"", the government is cracking down on Christians more aggressively through legal means. In March, a prominent Chinese house church leader with U.S. permanent residency was sentenced to seven years in prison after he built Christian schools in Myanmar. And half a dozen Christians were sentenced last month to up to 13 years in jail for involvement in a ""cult,"" according to U.S.-based Christian non-profit ChinaAid. The pressure has pushed several dozen pastors and their families to flee to the United States in recent years, ChinaAid says. The wife of one pastor under house arrest left for Midland, Texas about a year ago, after authorities warned that their children might have trouble getting an education in China. She said members of their church in China were barred from being baptized, and even a simple Christmas service was interrupted. ""The government says that we have religious freedom, but really there is no freedom at all,"" said the pastor's wife, who asked to remain anonymous for her husband's safety. ""Many of our Christian brothers and sisters are upset and fearful."" Those who resist pay the price. After Jin Mingri, a prominent pastor who leads Zion Church in Beijing, refused local authorities' request to install surveillance cameras inside his house church, police individually questioned hundreds of members of the 1,500-person congregation, he said. The congregants faced veiled threats, Jin said, and many were asked to sign a pledge promising to leave Zion, which the government agents called illegal, politically incorrect and a cult. Some people lost their jobs or were evicted from rented apartments because police intimidated their bosses and landlords. For 11 years, the church has been housed on one floor of an office building, but the property management informed Jin in May that they would have to move out at the end of the summer. Jin said the management admitted to being influenced by external ""pressures."" ""A lot of our flock are terrified by the pressure that the government is putting on them,"" he said. ""It's painful to think that in our own country's capital, we must pay so dearly just to practice our faith."" ___ At the epicenter of the drive to control the Christian community in China is Henan, the cradle of Chinese civilization and the entry point for many of the earliest foreign missionaries. Today, the province is one of the most populous in the country and a key part of Xi's fight against poverty, as proclaimed by red banners across acres of peanut farms and oil fields. Around the time authorities ordered Guo's church to stop congregating in March, his district announced a crackdown on private Christian meeting spots. On a single Sunday morning, the announcement said, 700 religious banners were removed, 200 religious texts seized and 31 illegal Christian gathering places shut down. Officials went door-to-door stripping decorative scrolls bearing the cross from home entrances. In Zhengzhou, Henan's capital, all that is left of one house church is shattered glass, tangled wires and torn hymnbooks, strewn among the rubble of a knocked-down wall. Pegged to another wall is a single wooden cross, still intact. The church inside a commercial building had served about 100 believers for years. But in late January, nearly 60 officials from the local religion department and police station appeared without warning. Armed with electric saws, they demolished the church, confiscated Bibles and computers and held a handful of young worshippers - including a 14-year-old girl - at a police station for more than 10 hours, according to a church leader. The authorities called the church illegal. The church leader said they had brought documentation to the religion department three or four times in an attempt to formally register it, but never received a response. Now, they have ceased to congregate. The church leader prays that the government will change its mind. ""We support President Xi,"" he said. ""All we ask for is a space for our faith."" That space for Xu Shijuan, a 63-year-old Seventh-Day Adventist, was her living room, where she held house church gatherings for four years. She stopped in March, after a group of men led by a local official ordered her to disband the meeting of about two dozen elderly Christians. ""If you don't heed our orders, the next group to come will be law enforcement,"" he said, according to Xu. ""They will use force to disband you."" Xu readily complied. ""The people have dispersed, but our faith has not,"" she told the AP at her home in Zhengzhou. ""God's path cannot be blocked. The more you try to control it, the more it will grow."" Even Protestant churches already registered with the state have not been spared greater restrictions. When reporters visited five such churches in Henan this June, all bore notices at their entrances stating that minors and party members were not allowed inside. A banner above one church door exhorted members to ""implement the basic direction of the party's religious work."" Another church erected a Chinese flag at the foot of its steps. Some congregations now sing the national anthem during services, according to a house church pastor named Liu. Another pastor said his government-approved church shut down its Sunday school and cancelled all activities for children after receiving orders in February. Across Henan, house churches that once hosted gatherings of hundreds have now sealed their doors and split into groups of no more than a handful. Services are announced last-minute and held in different locations each week, often under the cloak of darkness. For a time, Guo's church did the same. They avoided congregating on Sundays to escape authorities' notice. But the church members were scared, and the group dwindled to 30. Authorities appealed to Guo to help gather information on his fellow Christians. He was given a form, reviewed by the AP, which asked for churchgoers' names, educational background and addresses, as well as the length of time they had been faithful and whether they were baptized. The brick house was largely deserted this summer. Around the door frame, tattered red outlines remained of a scroll that once read ""God's love is as deep as the sea."" Inside, Guo has refused to remove the cross and other decorations, telling authorities they are within his private property. Among them, pinned to a wall in the nave, is a bright blue poster that quotes China's constitutional promise of religious freedom. ___ AP writer Brian Skoloff contributed to this report from Midland, Texas. ___ Follow Yanan Wang on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yananw          In this photo taken Monday, June 4, 2018, a painting of the Last Supper is seen next to posters quoting China's constitution on religious freedom in a house church shut down by authorities near the city of Nanyang in central China's Henan province.

38,What China can teach us on research,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-5195799/What-China-teach-research.html," 20:47 BST, 19 December 2017 ","During his report to the 19th CPC National Congress, President Xi Jinping disclosed his plans for the future of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).He said: 'We will make it our mission to see that by 2035, the modernisation of our national defence and our forces is basically complete; and that by the mid-21st century our people's armed forces have been fully transformed into world-class forces.'The Chinese media announced: 'As chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), Xi is tasked with ensuring the world's largest military take a ""crucial leap"" in the new era from being simply large to being strong.'          China is said to be building a giant facial recognition database to identify any citizenA few weeks earlier, The South China Morning Post wrote about 'China building giant facial recognition database to identify any citizen:'. Project The project is to achieve an accuracy rate of 90 per cent, though it faces formidable technological hurdles and there are serious concerns about privacy. The powerful facial recognition system should be able to identify 1.3 billion citizens within three seconds. Chen Jiansheng, of the department of electrical engineering at Tsinghua University, told the Hong Kong newspaper that the government would use this system to track wanted suspects as well as for public administration. In April 2107, the McKinsey Global Institute published a report entitled Artificial Intelligence: Implications for China, which describes the importance of artificial intelligence (AI): 'The idea that computer systems can perform functions typically associated with the human mind, has gone from futuristic speculation to present-day reality.'          During his report to the 19th CPC National Congress, President Xi Jinping disclosed his plans for the technological advancement of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)The report further elaborated: 'Thanks to advances in data collection and aggregation, algorithms, and processing power, computer scientists have achieved significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. Where computer systems once had to be programmed to execute rigidly defined tasks, they can now be given a generalised strategy for learning, enabling them to adapt to new data inputs without being explicitly reprogrammed.' In the years to come, the PLA plans to benefit from AI to enhance its efficiency 'to win wars' and reach the objectives fixed by Xi Jinping. Elsa Kania from the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) noted in a recent report: 'China is no longer in a position of technological inferiority relative to the United States but rather has become a true peer (competitor) that may have the capability to overtake the United States in AI.'        She adds: 'It could alter future economic and military balances of power.' The main use of AI is part of the in-depth reforms of China's defence forces for a wider 'integration' of the different services which are now five. At par with the PLA Ground Forces, Navy and Air Force, are the PLA Rocket Force (formerly, the second artillery) and the Strategic Support Force (SSF), a game changer, according to all observers. The use of AI will come under the umbrella of the PLASSF. The Diplomat noted a few months back: 'While the Chinese PLA's new SSF is a critical force for dominance in the space, cyber and electromagnetic domains… the SSF's function of 'strategic support', namely information support, will be equally vital to the PLA's capabilities to fight and win wars.'        Apart from restructuring the commands, Xi Jinping also wants to give a boost to research and development (R&D) to catch up with the United States in terms of new weaponry in the decades to come. A couple of weeks ago, the Chinese Central Television (CCTV) broadcast a TV documentary about the 10 aircraft carriers planned by China. Jane's Review reported that Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will 'be fitted onto the second of the country's indigenously built aircraft carriers, commonly referred to as the Type 002'; the system is similar to the EMALS used by the United States. Technologies A lot of money is also poured into the Hypersonic Vehicle Technology Project; available data shows that China has started developing conceptual and experimental hypersonic flight vehicle technologies such as hypersonic cruise vehicles (HCV) capable of manoeuvring at Mach 5 speeds (6,150 km/h), flying in near-space altitudes. It could be another game changer. Cutting-edge research in the field of quantum communication (which will make communications un-hackable) is also undertaken by the Chinese scientists. The Academy of Military Sciences explicitly asserted: 'Space and cyberspace increasingly constitute important battlefields. A new type of five-dimensional battle- space of land, sea, air, space, and cyber is currently taking shape, which is wide in scope, hyper-dimensional, and combines the tangible and intangible.' Innovation The list of new fields of research is long. China is, for example, working on an unmanned combat aerial vehicle named the 'Black Sword', which could one day compete with the best US drones.        Also in the list are smart materials and structures, high-temperature superconducting technologies, and highly efficient energy materials technologies. Beijing has a medium and long-term programme which aims at transforming China into an 'innovation-oriented society' by 2020; the plan defines China's leading-edge technologies. Beijing has also 'megaprojects for assimilating and absorbing' technology; an import substitution action plan in order to create indigenous innovations through 'co-innovation' and 're-innovation' of foreign technologies. In all probability, the Israeli Heron drone, which recently fell in Chinese hands in Chumbi Valley in Tibet, will soon be 'assimilated and absorbed'.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Russia, India and China: The triangle that matters    India and China agree to border talks in the fight against...

39,Chinese president hails military in show of might,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4743560/Chinese-president-hails-military-might.html," 09:19 BST, 30 July 2017 "," China’s military has the “confidence and capability” to bolster the country’s rise into a world power, President Xi Jinping said as he oversaw a large-scale parade meant to show off China’s fighting prowess. Live state television broadcasts showed Mr Xi, dressed in fatigues and speaking from an open-top jeep, telling his troops that China needs a strong military “more than ever” as it moves “closer to the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”. Mr Xi, who commands the People’s Liberation Army as chairman of the Central Military Commission, has frequently spoken of his “China Dream” to restore China to a leadership position in international affairs with a modern, far-reaching military force to match.          Image taken from video showing Xi Jinping inspecting troops  He inspected troops, armoured vehicles and conventional and nuclear missiles, hailing each formation by shouting “Comrades, you’ve worked hard”. The parade at the Zhurihe military training base in China’s Inner Mongolia region marked the 90th anniversary of the People’s Liberation Army’s founding. Long criticised as a corrupt bureaucracy with scant combat experience, the PLA has undergone reforms and an ambitious modernisation programme to make it a leaner force capable of projecting power overseas.          Soldiers march during the parade (Ju Zhenhua/Xinhua via AP)  Hundreds of thousands of troops have been cut from the world’s largest standing army while the PLA has invested heavily in aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines and stealth fighters with the goal of surpassing the United States in regional and even global influence. Although China has framed its growing military as a force for stability and peace, its expanding footprint and assertive posture in contested regions like the South China Sea has worried small neighbouring nations. Domestically, Mr Xi has taken steps to enhance his control over the PLA, just as he has over every other political power base within the sprawling Communist Party.          Soldiers take part in a flag-raising ceremony (Pang Xinglei/Xinhua via AP)  Despite the military establishment’s clout, he has not shied from ordering anti-corruption campaigns that took down top-ranking generals and creating new battle theatres that placed trusted officers in command and shunted aside others. To reinforce his political position, Mr Xi has extracted televised vows of loyalty from top generals while holding frequent events to show his affinity and support for the military, including a troop inspection in Hong Kong in June and a ceremony to present citations to 10 officers last week. Mr Xi again issued a demand for loyalty on Sunday, instructing his amassed troops to “unswervingly stick to the fundamental principle and system of the party’s absolute leadership over the army”. He added: “Always listen to and follow the party’s orders. And march to wherever the party points to.”"

41,China unveils new leadership line-up with no clear successor to Xi,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-5014935/China-unveils-new-leadership-line-no-obvious-Xi-successor.html," 05:35 BST, 25 October 2017 "," By Philip Wen and Ben Blanchard BEIJING, Oct 25 (Reuters) - China's ruling Communist Party broke with recent precedent on Wednesday, unveiling a new leadership line-up without a clear successor to President Xi Jinping, who has become arguably the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. Xi led his team in order of rank on to a stage at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, overlooking Tiananmen Square, culminating a week-long party conclave at which he laid out his vision for an increasingly prosperous China confident of its place on the world stage. Apart from Xi, Premier Li Keqiang was the only one to retain his spot amid sweeping changes on the Politburo Standing Committee. There has been persistent speculation Xi could seek to stay on in some capacity beyond the end of his customary second five years in power, which began on Wednesday. All seven Standing Committee members are men in their 60s and, for the first time, none was born before China's 1949 Communist revolution. The make-up of the committee, which has ultimate control over the world's second-largest economy, appeared to be a compromise to include a blend of Xi allies and those considered loyal to party elders, including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, former presidents whose networks still wield influence. Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, said Xi appeared to have traded securing favourable amendments to the constitution in exchange for a compromise on the make-up of the Standing Committee, a line-up he likened to a ""team of rivals"". The member considered closest to Xi is Li Zhanshu, who has often accompanied Xi on overseas trips in a chief-of-staff-style role as the head the party's General Office. Li, who is not related to the premier, was named the third-ranked member, meaning he will most likely assume the role of head of the largely rubber-stamp parliament. That will not be confirmed until parliament meets in March. Xi had already strengthened his hand considerably ahead of the announcement, with his political theory and ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure-led development strategy put into the party constitution. He was named the party's ""core"" last year. POLITICAL CAPITAL Guangdong party secretary Hu Chunhua and Chongqing party boss Chen Miner had been previously seen as prominent contenders to succeed Xi among the party's so-called sixth generation of leaders but were not included in the Standing Committee. Instead, both were named to the wider 25-member Politburo, a rung below the Standing Committee. ""He's consolidated his power without making unnecessary problems for himself,"" said David Zweig, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ""The costs of keeping Wang Qishan or getting Chen Miner were too high. He didn't need to do it."" Wang, who led Xi's sweeping anti-graft campaign and was considered China's second most-powerful politician, is above retirement age; Chen was comparatively junior. While the Standing Committee bears the hallmarks of compromise, the new Politburo is stacked with more than a dozen Xi allies, including Chen, Beijing party boss Cai Qi, economic adviser Liu He and Ding Xuexiang, who is expected to become Xi's chief of staff as director of the party's General Office. ""Xi has managed to put a lot of his own people there, as much as possible,"" said Bo Zhiyue, a New Zealand-based expert on Chinese politics. ""Most of Xi's close associates are too junior to be put into the Politburo Standing Committee right away."" 'DREAM TEAM' Blanket state media coverage made no mention of factional politics or alliances, while an editorial on the official People's Daily's WeChat account hailed the new seven-man line-up as a ""dream team"" to lead China into its ""new era"". Xi, who has sought to revitalise the Communist Party's role across Chinese society, made no mention of who his successor might be as he introduced his new Standing Committee at a media event broadcast live around the country. His remarks were translated consecutively into English. Xi did not take questions, but said the party had weathered trials and tribulations. ""We will also work with other nations to build a global community with a shared future, and make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of peace and development for all humanity,"" he said. Xi and Li were first promoted to the Standing Committee at the 17th Party Congress in 2007, in a clear signal that the pair would succeed Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao and occupy the top two offices - which they did five years later. Zhao Leji, who headed the party's Organisation Department, which oversees personnel decisions, replaced Wang Qishan as chief of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.

42,Top Chinese Communist Party meeting starts in Beijing,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3865896/Top-Chinese-Communist-Party-meeting-starts-Beijing.html," 05:47 BST, 24 October 2016 ","Top Chinese Communist Party meeting starts in Beijing By Afp   Published: 05:47 BST, 24 October 2016  |  Updated: 05:48 BST, 24 October 2016                e-mail         A key conclave of China's Communist Party elite kicked off Monday in Beijing, the official Xinhua news service reported, as leader Xi Jinping seeks to tighten his control over the organisation.Nearly 400 top members of the world's most powerful political party have gathered at the exclusive Jingxi Hotel to discuss changes to party structure and management for four days.They will focus on reforming the ""norms for political life"" and the party's internal rules for supervising cadres, Xinhua said.        ""This year¿s plenum on party-building is key to Xi¿s entire political project, and could very well turn out to be the most important of his first term,"" said Trey McArver ©Money Sharma (AFP) The dry rhetoric around the Sixth Plenum, as the meeting is known, hides what may be a ferocious, high-stakes battle for control over the world's second-largest economy.""This year’s plenum on party-building is key to Xi’s entire political project, and could very well turn out to be the most important of his first term,"" said Trey McArver, China analyst at Trusted Sources.It ""looks certain to further consolidate his grip over the party"", he added.Since taking its helm in 2012, General Secretary Xi Jinping has sought to bend it to his will, and taken control of more levers of power than any leader since Mao Zedong.His most powerful tool for bringing the party to heel has been an anti-corruption campaign that is now ""the longest-lasting, (and) widest-ranging in party history"", McArver said.The party's Central Commission for Discipline and Inspection, its feared internal watchdog, said at the weekend that between 2013 and last month, more than one million members had been punished for graft.China's ruling party has 88 million members.Xi has felled top generals in the People's Liberation Army and seemingly invincible bastions of power such as former security czar Zhou Yongkang, eliminating potential rival sources of power.But it has laid waste to the party's organisational chart, paralysing grassroots bureaucrats petrified of making a mistake, a problem compounded by unclear and contradictory signals on what policies to pursue.New policies will seek to address ""outstanding problems"" and compel senior leaders to be a good example for lesser officials, Xinhua said.That could mean tightening regulations governing cadres' behaviour and strengthening enforcement, analysts say.Xi has described the party as a ""magic weapon"" that can be used to implement reforms necessary to achieve his goal of the ""Great Rejuvenation"" of the Chinese nation, an idea that he frequently describes as the ""Chinese dream""."
43,China's Xi seen at center of emerging culture of praise,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2985096/Chinas-Xi-seen-center-emerging-culture-praise.html," 13:48 BST, 8 March 2015 ","China's Xi seen at center of emerging culture of praise By Associated Press   Published: 13:48 BST, 8 March 2015  |  Updated: 13:49 BST, 8 March 2015                e-mail         BEIJING (AP) — His smiling visage beams from decorative plates and plastic trinkets sold in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. State television coverage is wallpapered with his signature slogans, and his every pronouncement and meeting with foreign dignitaries leads the nightly news broadcast.Not one, but two books collect Chinese President Xi Jinping's speeches and favorite classical Chinese allusions — highly unusual in that they have been published so early in his tenure instead of after his retirement.Barely two years into office, Xi has attracted an extraordinary degree of attention to his public persona that veers perilously close to a full-blown personality cult. Such a phenomenon has not been seen since the days of Mao Zedong, with successors wary of the turmoil his leadership unleashed and generally favoring a dry, rule-by-consensus approach.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong) While the attention on Xi reflects his popularity with the public, it's also a sign of how thoroughly he's consolidated power by sidelining or reducing the influence of rivals in the ruling Communist Party. Like Chairman Mao, Xi even has a popular personal sobriquet: ""Xi Dada,"" roughly translated as ""Daddy Xi.""The son of a party elder, Xi has always had a sense of destiny about himself, say observers and those who knew him as a younger man, believing that he and others in the ""second red generation"" are the rightful inheritors of the communist state.The portly, round-faced Xi isn't about to replace the portrait of Mao hanging from Tiananmen Gate in the heart of Beijing. But he's becoming more and more of a ubiquitous presence in Chinese life, and a nearly unstoppable force behind the scenes.""It's as if Xi is saying, 'It's my party and I'll have it the way I want to,'"" said June Teufel Dreyer, a China politics expert at the University of Miami.Xi is front-and-center again as the national legislature holds its annual session in Beijing, seated in the heart of the vast Great Hall of the People and meeting with delegates from across the sprawling nation. The National People's Congress session, which opened Thursday, includes a report summarizing the accomplishments of the past year and laying out the agenda for the next 12 months.Formally, Xi's power is derived from his three main titles as Communist Party secretary-general, president of the People's Republic of China and chairman of the Central Military Commission that controls the 2.3 million-member armed forces, the world's largest standing military.Yet, he has significantly augmented his authority by heading up a long list of leadership panels on key issues from the economy to Internet policy, leaving Premier Li Keqiang, supposedly his partner in governance, a much diminished figure. Xi even established a new national security council with himself as chairman, a feat attempted but ultimately abandoned by his predecessors.""We certainly see an attempt to cultivate a personality cult, and this is only natural because he wants to concentrate power in his hands, to have the momentum and the political force in order to promote his program,"" said Joseph Cheng, chair of the political science department at the City University of Hong Kong.An imposing personal presence may be a prerequisite for shoving through Xi's ambitious agenda. With planning and patience, Xi has prosecuted a sweeping anti-corruption crackdown that has ensnared top generals and party officials. He's injected China into world events where former leaders feared to tread, struck a bold climate agreement with the U.S. and launched a sweeping vision for a ""New Silk Road"" linking China to markets in western Asia.That authority seems to have given him and his close supporters the confidence to spread his personal maxims, pronouncements and policies as far as they can go.""I think it is all kind of somewhat more reflective of the leadership style under Mao Zedong or (successor) Deng Xiaoping, as compared to anything we've seen more recently,"" former U.S. ambassador to Beijing Jon Huntsman said at a recent Council on Foreign Relations forum in Washington.Efforts to boost Xi's image were underscored at last month's nationally televised Lunar New Year gala, with his political themes, particularly his concept of the ""Chinese Dream,"" saturating the cavalcade of skits, songs and filmed segments. In one highlight, performers crooned a syrupy musical tribute titled ""I Give You My Heart"" in front of film clips of Xi handing out blankets, chatting with farmers and otherwise humbly serving the Chinese people.Xi's pet slogan also made it into the final applause line of Premier Li Keqiang's annual address to the national legislature on Thursday, in which he told delegates that achieving the year's goals would help realize ""the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.""State broadcaster CCTV's nightly coverage of Xi's events include meetings with visiting dignitaries no matter how obscure. His visits to other cities and rural areas, meanwhile, are packaged in a manner reminiscent of European propaganda of the 1930s.Xi's hosting of President Barack Obama and other world leaders at last year's meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Beijing was a particular showcase of his glitzy, personality-driven diplomacy. On the evening before the summit, CCTV ran hours of coverage of Xi greeting visiting heads of state at an elaborate banquet, joined by glamorous wife Peng Liyuan, a former diva with a military song and dance troupe, who often accompanies him on high-profile visits abroad.A major military parade planned for the 70th anniversary of Japan's surrender at the end of World War II on Aug. 15 offers a further opportunity to place Xi front and center.Predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao also presided at military parades, but only in the twilight of their terms in office, points out Willy Lam, a Chinese politics expert at Hong Kong's Chinese University. By associating himself so early with such powerful images, Xi is showing that he sees himself as China's third major leader after Mao and Deng, Lam said.""The cult of personality around Xi is being built at full throttle, and Xi himself is responsible for this,"" Lam said. ""It's getting to ridiculous levels.""At the same time, Xi has sought to burnish his credential as a man of the people, appearing unannounced at a Beijing dumpling stall, kicking around a football and carrying his own umbrella. Such poses shouldn't be confused with candor or accessibility, however: Xi almost never speaks to journalists and his personal life remains largely off-limits to the media.And unlike Mao, Xi shows no sign of directly appealing to the public to join him in any political campaigns — as with the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution era in which Mao appealed to the masses to help him purge China's establishment of reactionaries. On the contrary, Xi's administration has made it clear that the party — and only the party — must be in control, and has squashed any efforts of citizens to mobilize, even on behalf of priorities that the party has professed, such as fighting corruption among officials or improving education.An early indication of Xi's rising stature was the publication last November of ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China,"" a 500-page volume of his collected speeches, talks, interviews, pronouncements and correspondence, with photos of him with his family, meeting world leaders, and carrying out the duties of head of state and chief of the armed forces.Chinese leaders regularly publish such tomes, but only well after they've left office.A more recent volume tracks Xi's use of classical Chinese allusions in his public statements. Published by the party's flagship newspaper, the People's Daily, ""Xi Jinping Uses the Classics"" cites 135 examples on topics from law to self-cultivation, drawn mainly from works associated with the ancient sage Confucius, as well as Song-dynasty administrator and literary figure Su Dongpo.Xi's image is also branching out into the arts. In February, 12,000 applicants to the Beijing University of Technology's art program were required to sketch a portrait of the leader in pencil and charcoal as part of their entrance exam. Students told reporters they could draw Xi practically from memory after seeing his face all over the media.No matter to what comfort level Xi consolidates his power, experts see little chance he'll use his clout to implement democratic reforms that might challenge the party's predominance.""Xi is actively trying to rein in precisely those elements of Chinese socio-political life — intellectual pluralism, popular participation, institutional checks and balances — that most of us would see as necessary for generating a more open, participatory political system,"" Boston University China expert Joseph Fewsmith said.

44,Xi declares 'new era' for China as party congress opens,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4990332/Chinas-Xi-set-enhance-powers-Communist-congress.html," 21:12 BST, 17 October 2017 ","          President Xi Jinping's opening speech was delivered to some 2,300 delegates assembled in the Great Hall of the People  President Xi Jinping declared China has embarked on a ""new era"" of challenges and opportunities on Wednesday as he opened a Communist Party congress expected to enhance his already formidable power. Xi told some 2,300 delegates at the imposing Great Hall of the People that the party must ""resolutely oppose"" any actions that undermine its leadership as it steers a course through a high-stakes period in its development. ""The situation both domestic and abroad is undergoing profound and complex changes,"" said Xi, who is expected to secure a second five-year term as general secretary and stack leadership positions with loyalists during the twice-a-decade congress. ""China's development is still in a stage of important strategic opportunities. The prospects are bright, but the challenges are also severe,"" he said in a marathon speech that exceeded three hours and was met by waves of applause. ""Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era,"" he said, envisioning a ""great modern socialist country"" by mid-century. Speaking in front of a massive hammer and sickle, Xi touted his nationalistic ""China dream"" slogan, vowed to open the economy, promised to win the fight against poverty, and pointedly warned he would continue his ""zero tolerance"" campaign against corruption.          No caption  Considered China's most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping or even Mao Zedong, Xi could use the congress to lay the foundation to stay atop the 89-million-strong party even longer than the normal 10 years, according to analysts. That would break the unwritten two-term limit accepted by his immediate predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao -- who were by Xi's side at the congress -- and end the era of ""collective leadership"" aimed at preventing the emergence of another Mao. Another signal of Xi's rise to the pantheon of Chinese leadership would be if his name is added to the party constitution, an honour that has only been bestowed upon modern China's founder, Mao, and the father of economic reforms, Deng. ""I want to sum up Xi's speech in one sentence: It is the political declaration of the Xi era,"" Chinese politics scholar Chen Daoyin told AFP. ""It is different from Mao's era and Deng's reform and opening era... Now we have entered an era of becoming strong."" - 'Tigers and flies' - Xi's rise has been marked by a relentless crackdown on dissent, with authorities even refusing to free Nobel peace prize laureate Liu Xiaobo as he lay dying of cancer in July. Potential rivals have also been swept aside under Xi's vast anti-corruption drive, which punished 1.3 million Communist Party officials over five years. Xi said the campaign has been ""unswervingly fighting against 'tigers', 'beating flies', 'hunting foxes'"" -- terms used for lower- and higher-ranking officials and fugitives.          A man walks past decorations for the Communist Party's 19th Congress in Tiananmen Square, on the eve of its opening  On other fronts, Xi touted efforts to complete the army's modernisation by 2035 and build artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea. In a stern warning to self-ruled Taiwan, he said China has the ""ability to defeat separatist attempts for Taiwan independence in any form"". Xi, who has championed globalisation in the face of President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies, vowed to further open up China's economy. Foreign companies complain that Xi's words have not been backed by deeds, as the state retains control over the economy. Trump, who will visit Beijing next month, has launched a trade investigation into China's intellectual property practises. ""China will not close its doors to the world, we will only become more and more open,"" Xi said. - Any heir apparent? - Authorities stepped up policing for the week-long congress, with red armband-wearing ""security volunteers"" fanning out across the capital, karaoke bars closing and knife sales restricted. Chinese tech companies restricted social media users from changing their profile pictures and names, while positive messages dominated Twitter-like Weibo and photos circulated of children watching the speech in classrooms. The conclave, which will mostly meet behind closed doors and end next Tuesday, will select new top party members, including for the Politburo Standing Committee, China's all-powerful ruling body.          Chinese soldiers march outside the Great Hall of the People on the eve of the opening of the 19th Communist Party Congress  Xi and Premier Li Keqiang are expected to remain on the committee while the five other current members are supposed to step down under an informal retirement age set at 68. But analysts say Xi's 69-year-old right-hand man and anti-graft chief, Wang Qishan, could stay on, creating a precedent for Xi himself to remain in charge beyond retirement age in 2022. But a Xi heir apparent could emerge from the congress. One former potential successor who was outside Xi's circle, Sun Zhengcai, was ousted from the party last month due to graft allegations. Chen Miner, a former Xi aide who succeeded Sun as political chief in the city of Chongqing, is now well positioned for promotion."
45,China's Xi looks to party congress to cement authority,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4794902/Chinas-Xi-looks-party-congress-cement-authority.html," 08:41 BST, 16 August 2017 "," BEIJING (AP) - In a ritual of summer, China's leaders have been holding an unofficial retreat at a beach resort ahead of a key fall Communist Party congress at which President Xi Jinping will launch his second five-year term as party chief and move to cement his status as China's most powerful leader in decades. The absence of top leaders from state media reports is a general indication that the secretive Beidaihe retreat is underway. In a hint that leaders have gathered at the resort's quiet beaches and closely guarded guest houses, the official Xinhua News Agency last week carried an account of a meeting at the resort between party propaganda boss Liu Yunshan and a group of vacationing technical experts. The strength of Xi's position likely means the goings-on this year on the coast east of Beijing will be even tamer than usual, analysts say.          In this file photo taken Sunday, July 30, 2017, and released by Xinhua News Agency, Chinese President Xi Jinping stands on a military jeep as he inspects troops of the People's Liberation Army during a military parade to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the founding of the PLA at Zhurihe training base in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. As they do each summer, China's leaders have headed to the beach for bit of relaxation and informal meetings on matters both trivial and weighty. This year's retreat will likely be a final breather ahead of a key party Communist Party congress expected in the fall at which President Xi Jinping will launch his second five-year term as party chief and cement his status as China's most powerful leader in decades. (Li Gang/Xinhua via AP)  Xi, 64, has been shoring up his authority and sidelining rivals, leaving him primed to install allies in top positions and press his agenda of tightened state control and muscular diplomacy. That appears to include a push to insert his thoughts on theoretical matters into the party constitution and further cultivate a burgeoning cult of personality that could allow him to hold on to power beyond his second term. ""The nuance this time is that there is much less 'trading' among various factions and more obsequious affirmation of the supreme leader's supremacy,"" said Miles Yu Maochun, an expert on Chinese politics at the U.S. Naval Academy. At the fall party congress, Xi is expected to deliver a keynote address as a prelude to having his take on theory written into the party constitution during the event, analysts believe. If indeed the case, the move's significance would be that predecessor Hu Jintao was able to insert his theory only upon leaving office. A government spokesman, State Council Information Office Director Jiang Jianguo, seemed to talk up that likelihood with fulsome praise for Xi's theories in recent comments to reporters. ""It is a narrative that has been mastered by the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people and become familiar to every ordinary Chinese. It has also become a force that can change the world,"" Jiang said. ""It is only natural for us to summarize this system of thought in a more accurate and scientific way."" Jiang also sought to quash talk of a cult of personality around Xi, calling him a ""modest and prudent man."" ""In the face of issues, he'd like to be the student first and learn from the people,"" Jiang said. The son of a famed communist elder, Xi rose through the ranks to the position of Shanghai's party leader before being promoted to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee in 2007. When Xi did assume the top spot in 2012, it was as head of a reduced seven-member committee on which he had only one reliable ally, veteran Wang Qishan. He put Wang in charge of a sweeping anti-corruption crackdown that helped Xi eliminate challengers, both serving and retired, and cow potential opponents. Xi, whose titles include head of the armed forces, has lavished attention on the military with parades and defense budget increases. But he's also led a crackdown on abuses and a push to cut 300,000 personnel from the 2.3 million-member People's Liberation Army, underscoring his ability to prevail against entrenched interests. At the same time, Xi has added to his resume additional titles as leader of more than a half dozen special commissions overseeing areas from national security to foreign policy. In a move carrying enormous symbolic weight, Xi last year took on the mantle of ""core"" of the party leadership, elevating him above his peers in a manner redolent of communist China's founder, Mao Zedong. Whether deliberate or not, moves by Xi seem designed to minimalize predecessor Hu's place in history. Xi has already presided over three major military parades, as opposed to Hu's one over his entire tenure as president. Even the newest generation of China's high-speed rail trains are now called ""rejuvenation"" - a term that features prominently in Xi's calls to realize the ""Chinese Dream"" of prosperity and strength. Older trains were named ""harmonious"" - a key Hu byword. Xi has also succeeded in constricting Premier Li Keqiang's traditional role of overseeing the economy through the appointment of his own advisers, while gutting the power of the China Youth League faction to which both Li and Hu belong. Such moves are ""a sign that no one in the party can challenge Xi's authority,"" said Chen Daoyin, a political scientist at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. Those who fail to pledge themselves to Xi's leadership do so at their peril, Chen said. That ensures Xi a free hand in making new appointments to the Politburo Standing Committee. Chief among his allies are Chen Min'er, who last month was appointed to run the mega-city of Chongqing after predecessor Sun Zhengcai - previously seen as a top leader in waiting - was placed under investigation for corruption. Chen could be joined on the standing committee by Beijing party chief Cai Qi, who has also enjoyed rapid promotion under Xi. Key aides within the party, most notably chief of staff Li Zhanshu, are also tipped for higher office, while there is speculation that Wang, the corruption-buster, will be retained. In several cases, those moves would defy loosely defined party norms regarding necessary work experience. Retaining Wang, who is due for retirement under existing precedents, would also be a break from tradition. That has fueled speculation that Xi may be eyeing a third term as party chief, breaking with the two-term limit roughly established by Hu and his predecessor, Jiang Zemin. Those moves have cast Xi as a disruptor, not afraid to disregard precedent and do things his own way, while keeping rivals off balance with a lack of clarity about promotions and processes. That's likely to disappoint those hoping for a stronger, rules-based system and greater transparency. ""The message to be delivered at Beidaihe regarding personnel arrangements is just a notice to tell everyone what Xi has decided, regardless of whether you're in agreement or not,"" Chen said. ___ Associated Press writer Gillian Wong and researcher Fu Ting contributed to this report.

46,Xi poised to extend power as China set to lift term limits,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5432341/Xi-extend-power-China-poised-lift-term-limits.html," 09:51 BST, 25 February 2018 ","          Xi is seen as China's most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong  Xi Jinping, China's most powerful leader for decades, could stay in office indefinitely after the Communist Party called for the removal of presidential term limits. Xi, who is also party chief and seen as the country's most formidable ruler since Mao Zedong, has been president since 2013 and the 64-year-old leader would have to step down in 2023 under the current system. But the party's Central Committee proposed deleting from the constitution the stipulation that a president ""shall serve no more than two consecutive terms"" of five years, the official Xinhua news agency reported Sunday. ""I think he will become emperor for life and the Mao Zedong of the 21st century"", Willy Lam, politics professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told AFP. ""If his health permits, he wants to serve 20 years, which would mean until 2032 as secretary general of the party, and 2033 as state president,"" Lam said. The proposed change, which would also apply to the vice-president, will be submitted to legislators at the annual full session of the rubber-stamp National People's Congress starting March 5. Xi is expected to be given a second term in office during the two-week-long session. Xi has been chipping away at the collective model of leadership that was promoted by Deng Xiaoping, the architect of the country's economic reforms in the 1980s. Xi's two predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, both served two five-year terms, but he has signalled bigger ambitions. - Name in constitution - At the 19th five-yearly Communist Party congress last October, Xi unveiled a new seven-member Politburo Standing Committee -- its top ruling body -- that lacked any clear heir apparent to him. He was also given the customary second term as party general secretary, a job which does not have a formal term limit. Xi also saw his eponymous political philosophy -- Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era -- included in the party's charter, an honour only accorded to one previous leader, Mao, during his lifetime. The Central Committee also proposed adding Xi's ""thought"" to the national constitution, joining Mao again. Since taking over as party general secretary in late 2012, Xi has waged a remorseless battle against corruption, which has seen more than one million people punished. Some also see the campaign as a means for him to eradicate internal opposition. A major outcome of the 19th Party Congress was the decision to establish a new anti-graft agency, the National Supervisory Commission, that will coordinate investigations at all levels of government and expand its remit to include non-party members. The Central Committee proposed listing the commission as a new state organ in the constitution. - 'Without opposition' - Xi told party officials on Saturday the constitution was key to building a moderately prosperous society, building a modern socialist country and realising the ""Chinese dream of national rejuvenation"" -- his slogan to restore the nation to its former glory. ""No organisation or individual has the privilege to overstep the constitution or the law,"" Xinhua quoted him as saying. Xi is keeping a key ally by his side as he cements power. The feared former head of the anti-graft agency, Wang Qishan, stepped down from the Standing Committee last October because at 69, he had reached the traditional retirement age. But Wang was selected earlier this year as a deputy to the upcoming National People's Congress annual session, fuelling speculation that he could become Xi's vice-president or gain some other influential role. Another ally and new Standing Committee member, Li Zhanshu, could become head of the National People's Congress. ""(Xi) would then ensure that his constitutional reform is adopted without opposition,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, China politics specialist at Hong Kong Baptist University. Xi's presidency has been marked by the return of a personality cult and a major crackdown on democracy and human rights. Earlier this year the party mouthpiece People's Daily further cemented his elevation by publishing an article that for the first time referred to him as ""lingxiu"" -- a Mao-era honorific with more reverential and spiritual connotations than the ordinary terms."

Share this article Share   Guo, a 62-year-old Chinese shopkeeper had waited nearly his entire adult life to see his dream of building a church come true - a brick house with a sunny courtyard and spacious hall with room for 200 believers.But in March, about a dozen police officers and local officials suddenly showed up at the church on his property and made the frightened congregants disperse. They ordered that the cross, a painting of the Last Supper and Bible verse calligraphy be taken down. And they demanded that all services stop until each person along with the church itself was registered with the government, said Guo, who gave his last name only from fear of retribution.Without warning, Guo and his neighbors in central Henan had found themselves on the front lines of an ambitious new effort by the officially atheist ruling Communist Party to dictate - and in some cases displace - the practice of faith in the country.The crackdown on Christianity is part of a broader push by Xi to 'Sinicise' all the nation's religions by infusing them with 'Chinese characteristics' such as loyalty to the Communist Party. Over the last several months, local governments across the country have shut down hundreds of private Christian 'house churches'. A statement last week from 47 in Beijing alone said they had faced 'unprecedented' harassment since February. A       A pastor, Jin Minri, leads a class on Christian beliefs at the Zion Church in Beijing. After Jin refused authorities' request to install surveillance cameras in his house church, police questioned hundreds of members of the 1,500-person congregation       A slogan outside a church reads 'Educate the believers with excellent Chinese traditional culture' near Pingdingshan, Henan       Chinese calligraphy reads 'All nations belong to the Lord arising to shine' at left and 'Jesus's salvation spreads to the whole world' at right are displayed below a crucifix in a house church shut down by authorities near the city of Nanyang, HenanA dozen Chinese Protestants interviewed by the Associated Press described gatherings that were raided, interrogations and surveillance, and one pastor said hundreds of his congregants were questioned individually about their faith. Like Guo, the majority requested that their names be partly or fully withheld because they feared punishment from authorities.'Chinese leaders have always been suspicious of the political challenge or threat that Christianity poses to the Communist regime,' said Xi Lian, a scholar of Christianity in China at Duke University. 'Under Xi, this fear of Western infiltration has intensified and gained a prominence that we haven't seen for a long time.'Officials once largely tolerated the unregistered Protestant house churches that sprang up independent of the official Christian Council, clamping down on some while allowing others to grow. But this year they have taken a tougher approach that relies partly on 'thought reform' - a phrase for political indoctrination. Last November, Christian residents of a rural township in south-east Jiangxi province were persuaded to replace posters of the cross and Jesus Christ inside their homes with portraits of Xi, a local official said. 'Through our thought reform, they've voluntarily done it,' Qi Yan, a member of the township party committee, told the AP by phone. 'The move is aimed at Christian families in poverty, and we educated them to believe in science and not in superstition, making them believe in the party.'        Children play near the entrance of a church with a sign reading 'Notice: Minors prohibited from entry' near Lushan, Henan       A slogan reading 'Religious activities should not interfere with social order and order of life' is displayed in Pingdingshan city       Pastor Jin Minri  said police previously individually questioned hundreds of members of the 1,500-person congregationThe poster campaign appears to symbolise what analysts see as the underlying force driving the change in the party's approach to religion: the ascendance of Xi.'Xi is a closet Maoist - he is very anxious about thought control,' said Willy Lam, a Chinese politics expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 'He definitely does not want people to be faithful members of the church, because then people would profess their allegiance to the church rather than to the party, or more exactly, to Xi himself.'Various state and local officials declined repeated requests to comment. But in 2016, Xi explicitly warned against the perceived foreign threats tied to faith, telling a religion conference: 'We must resolutely guard against overseas infiltrations via religious means.'Those who resist pay the price. After Jin Mingri, a prominent pastor who leads Zion Church in Beijing, refused local authorities' request to install surveillance cameras inside his house church, police individually questioned hundreds of members of the 1,500-person congregation, he said. The congregants faced veiled threats, Jin said, and many were asked to sign a pledge promising to leave Zion, which the government agents called illegal, politically incorrect and a cult. Some people lost their jobs or were evicted from rented apartments because police intimidated their bosses and landlords.        A poster of Chinese President Xi Jinping and part of the slogan which reads 'Actively play the leading role of party building and comprehensively implement the plan for poverty alleviation' near Pingdingshan city in central China's Henan province       A woman hangs laundry near a church in the city of Pingdingshan in central China's Henan province       Xu Shijuan, a 63-year-old Seventh-Day Adventist sings gospel songs at her home in Zhengzhou in Henan province'A lot of our flock are terrified by the pressure that the government is putting on them,' he said. 'It's painful to think that in our own country's capital, we must pay so dearly just to practice our faith.'In Zhengzhou, Henan's capital, all that is left of one house church is shattered glass, tangled wires and torn hymnbooks, strewn among the rubble of a knocked-down wall. Pegged to another wall is a single wooden cross, still intact.The church inside a commercial building had served about 100 believers for years. But in late January, nearly 60 officials from the local religion department and police station appeared without warning. Armed with electric saws, they demolished the church, confiscated Bibles and computers and held a handful of young worshippers - including a 14-year-old girl - at a police station for more than 10 hours, according to a church leader.Even Protestant churches already registered with the state have not been spared greater restrictions. When reporters visited five such churches in Henan this June, all bore notices at their entrances stating that minors and party members were not allowed inside. A banner above one church door exhorted members to 'implement the basic direction of the party's religious work.' Another church erected a Chinese flag at the foot of its steps.        A child stands near a slogan that reads 'Communist party members cannot take part in religious activities'       A photo of President Xi Jinping is seen near the Christian poster with the word 'Grace' outside a house church near Nanyang       Locals in Henan province stated concerns of a move by the atheist ruling Community Party to control Christianity  Guo's brick house was largely deserted this summer. Around the door frame, tattered red outlines remained of a scroll that once read 'God's love is as deep as the sea.'Inside, Guo has refused to remove the cross and other decorations, telling authorities they are within his private property.Among them, pinned to a wall in the nave, is a bright blue poster that quotes China's constitutional promise of religious freedom.Elsewhere in China, religious practices and activities remain strictly controlled. In Xinjiang, a Muslim-majority region in the country's far west, millions of ethnic Uighurs face repression and torture as authorities claimed to rule out potential separatist movements. Former inmates have told of the horror after being detained in what the Chinese government calls 'political re-education camps', where they were physically and mentally tortured and as punishment, were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol.        A resident walks past a government billboard citing core values of the Communist Party near a church in Pingdingshan       The character for 'love' is displayed at the gated entrance of a church near Pingdingshan city in Henan province       A man drives past the slogans for 'Patriotism and Love for the church, Glorifying God and serving human beings' in HenanIn late July, children in traditionally Buddhist Tibet were required to sign an agreement to 'not take part in any form of religious activity' during the summer holidays, according to the Global Times.The policy appears to reflect increasingly harsh restrictions on the Himalayan region's traditional Buddhist culture, largely aimed at reducing the influence of the region's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India.On Tuesday, state media announced that all religious institutions across the country are now required to fly the national flag, in a move to assimilate religions into the socialist society.The rule is necessary to strengthen awareness of respect for the flag - a symbol of the country's embrace of communism in 1949 - and preserve the flag's dignity, Xinhua claimed, adding that the practice can enhance the public's national consciousness and civic awareness. "
48,Hosting World Cup would be dream for China -deputy football chief,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4542994/Hosting-World-Cup-dream-China-deputy-football-chief.html," 22:04 BST, 25 May 2017 "," By Michael Church HONG KONG, May 26 (Reuters) - The Chinese Football Association vice president said hosting a future World Cup would be ""a dream"" for China, but declined to say when the nation would bid to organise football's showcase event. Zhang Jian was elected to the FIFA Council - the global soccer governing body's main decision-making entity - at the Asian Football Confederation's congress in Bahrain earlier this month, underlining China's growing influence in the sport. With Chinese President Xi Jinping having already declared his desire to see the country qualify for, host and win the World Cup, speculation has been mounting that the nation would make a move to organise the tournament in 2030 or 2034. But Zhang was quick to dispel suggestions a decision has been made by the Chinese authorities. ""To host the World Cup in China is our dream, so many Chinese people, Chinese football fans' dream, but which World Cup we will bid for we didn't decide officially,"" Zhang said in a BBC World Service interview. ""We should decide it by official procedure. For me I think it should come to China sooner but we need some time to prepare and we need time to popularise our football and enhance our football level,"" he said. ""According to FIFA statutes we need to meet some other requirements, so I have no concrete time now."" Football in China has undergone significant growth since President Xi took the nation's helm in 2013, with clubs spending huge sums to lure some of the world's best players to the Chinese Super League (CSL). CHINA LURING PRICEY STAR PLAYERS Shanghai SIPG have broken the Asian transfer record twice in the last year, signing Hulk from Zenit St Petersburg for 55 million euros ($61.61 million) before spending another 60 million euros to lure Oscar from Chelsea in the winter. With Carlos Tevez, Ezequiel Lavezzi and others enticed by large salaries, Chinese clubs are now being linked with some of the biggest names in the game as a transfer battle with European clubs threatens to develop. However, the CFA announced on Wednesday new measures designed to cool the player market, with clubs already carrying debt forced to pay a sum equal to fees paid for foreign signings into a fund to develop Chinese players. New rules will also be implemented in next year's CSL that will see clubs forced to field the same number of players under the age of 23 as they do foreigners in their starting line-ups. ""To be frank, it's a good thing and a bad thing,"" said Zhang, who was interviewed before the latest regulations were announced, of the money pouring into Chinese football. ""We should have a good balance for it. We are discussing it and we have made some decisions to take some action. But generally I think it's a good thing,"" Zhang said. ""The good thing is that we can make the market very active and we can attract so many people, especially so many young people to play football. I think it's very good to encourage young men to love football and participate in football. ""But on the other hand the bad thing is that we should have a good balance between the investment and the outcome so sometimes we need some order, we should keep good order and we are adjusting our policies and we are not taking absolute measures to stop it,"" he continued. ""We should be calm and should slow down our growth and keep good order to keep the potential and don't break the market, don't break the order. This is the important thing. We need order. Sometimes order is much more important."" ($1 = 0.8928 euros) (Reporting by Michael Church in Hong Kong; editing by Mark Heinrich)"

Xi's reappointment by the Communist Party-controlled legislature is a foregone conclusion, but all eyes will be on whether his former anti-corruption enforcer, Wang Qishan, will become his deputy, as expected by analysts. The National People's Congress has widely expanded Xi's already considerable authority during its annual session, adding his name to the constitution and lifting the two five-year term limit for the presidency and vice presidency. As part of the package of constitutional amendments, the president and other government officials will for the first time take the oath of office by pledging allegiance to the constitution. Elevating Wang would allow Xi to keep a formidable ally by his side as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong cements his authority and sets his sights on a possible lifelong tenure. Wang, 69, stepped down from the Communist Party's ruling council in October under informal retirement rules. But he has kept a prominent profile, sitting at the same table as the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee during the public sessions of the National People's Congress. Known internationally in his previous role as China's pointman on trade, analysts say Wang could help Xi handle increasingly tense relations with the United States amid fears of a looming trade war. Wang was at the frontline of Xi's anti-corruption crusade, heading the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which punished 1.5 million officials in the past five years, from low-level cadres to regional leaders and generals. Xi's most important title is general secretary of the Communist Party, but by putting a retired party loyalist in the vice presidency, he would again be breaking with party norms and unwritten rules of succession. - 'Dream team' - Xi is keeping Wang by his side because of his ""talent and ability,"" according to Hua Po, an independent Chinese political commentator. ""Choosing Wang as vice president is certainly to consolidate his power,"" Hua told AFP. ""Xi is already a very powerful man. The problem is that he has too few people who are loyal and competent for his use, so he has to retain Wang and give himself more time to cultivate more talented people."" Wang would replace Li Yuanchao, a relatively low-profile politician who has represented Xi on trips abroad. When he was vice premier, Wang periodically travelled to the United States, where president Barack Obama once gave the Chinese delegation a signed basketball that the official held up at a press conference. An ""amazing"" economist, Wang could now form a ""dream team"" with another member of the party leadership, Wang Yang, to deal with US President Donald Trump's trade threats, said Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King's College London. ""Maybe they'll be able to come up with a solution for this massive brewing storm with America about imbalances and tariffs,"" Brown told AFP."

51,"China's Xi tells Hong Kong he seeks ""far-reaching future"" for its autonomy",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4650892/Chinas-Xi-tells-Hong-Kong-seeks-far-reaching-future-autonomy.html," 14:07 BST, 29 June 2017 "," By Venus Wu and James Pomfret HONG KONG, June 29 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Thursday China would work to ensure a ""far-reaching future"" for Hong Kong's autonomy, but he faces a divided city with protesters angered by Beijing's perceived interference as it marks 20 years of Chinese rule. Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, under a ""one country, two systems"" formula which guarantees wide-ranging freedoms and judicial independence unseen in mainland China. Beijing has promised Hong Kong's capitalist system will remain unchanged for ""at least"" 50 years until 2047, but it has not clarified what happens after that. ""Hong Kong has always tugged at my heartstrings,"" Xi said on arrival at Hong Kong airport for the handover anniversary in front of flag-waving crowds at the start of a three-day visit. ""... We are willing, together with different sectors of Hong Kong society, to look back on Hong Kong's unusual course in the past 20 years, draw conclusions from the experience, look into the future and to ensure 'one country, two systems' is stable and has a far-reaching future."" Xi's message was consistent with those of other senior Chinese leaders visiting Hong Kong, that Beijing will safeguard the city's development and prosperity. In reality, however, fears of the creeping influence of Communist Party leaders in Beijing have been starkly exposed in recent years by the abduction by mainland agents of some Hong Kong booksellers who specialised in politically sensitive material and Beijing's efforts in disqualifying two pro-independence lawmakers elected to the city legislature. Xi did not respond to journalists, including one who asked whether Liu Xiaobo, China's Nobel Peace Laureate and jailed dissident, would be released and allowed to travel overseas to be treated for cancer. Speaking later, Xi praised Hong Kong's outgoing leader, Leung Chun-ying, who cracked down hard on pro-democracy Occupy protests in 2014, for his substantial contributions to the country, ""especially safeguarding national security"". ""These past five years have not been easy at all,"" Xi added. He urged officials to support incoming leader Carrie Lam, who will be sworn in on Saturday, and contribute to the ""China dream"". An annual July 1 protest pressing social causes, including a call for full democracy, is expected to take place after Xi leaves on Saturday. On Wednesday night, police arrested several well-known pro-democracy activists, some of whom scrambled up a monument symbolising the city's handover from British to Chinese rule. Among them was student leader Joshua Wong, who said on his Facebook page on Thursday his detention for more than 16 hours was highly unusual and police had yet to take his statement. [For a package of handover stories, http://reut.rs/2sje26J] HONG KONG ""HAS BEEN LIED TO"" Part of the major rift under Chinese rule in Hong Kong has been a push by activists, including the 2014 street protests, to get China to live up to a constitutional promise under Hong Kong's mini-constitution to allow universal suffrage as an ""ultimate aim"". ""This promise has been shattered under the watchful eyes of the whole world,"" organisers of Saturday's planned rally wrote in a statement. ""Hong Kong has been lied to for 20 years. Let's retake Hong Kong for a real and fully fledged democracy."" A massive security presence is expected with thousands of police deployed to maintain order as protests simmer. At least 200 protesters sat in sweltering heat outside Hong Kong's highest court on Thursday night to demand the release of dissident Liu. ""Xi Jinping should release Liu Xiaobo,"" said Annie Tam, who watched as her six-year-old son held a candle. ""I respect Liu very much. He really is sacrificing himself for democracy."" The streets of Hong Kong have been festooned with Chinese banners and paraphernalia, including two huge harbourfront screens carrying celebratory messages. Upwards of 120,000 youngsters will join China patriotic activities at a time of growing disillusionment with Beijing among the city's younger generation. ""We ... just hope our people can live in peace and contentment,"" said Lee Wing-lung, 66, a retired engineer standing opposite the hotel where Xi is staying, taking snapshots with his phone. ""I hope Hong Kong can have a good and peaceful atmosphere."" British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said in London Britain hopes that Hong Kong will make more progress towards democracy. ""As we look to the future, Britain hopes that Hong Kong will make more progress towards a fully democratic and accountable system of government,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""Britain´s commitment to Hong Kong - enshrined in the Joint Declaration with China - is just as strong today as it was 20 years ago."" Many observers point out that the British did nothing to promote democracy until the dying days of more than 150 years of colonial rule. Britain, looking for new trade partners as Brexit approaches, is also keen not to upset China, the world's second-largest economy. Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last governor, told the Guardian newspaper British ""kowtowing"" to China would become increasingly craven after Brexit.

It also shows multiple warheads soaring into the skies and blowing up targets.            The video features multiple DF-41 missiles (pictured), which is said to have the longest range of any ballistic rockets in the world and could reach London or the U.S. with nuclear warheads.         The video was released yesterday by the Rocket Force through its official Weibo accountChina has claimed to own around 2,500 missiles. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has two series of missiles, the Dongfeng or 'East Wind' guided missiles and the Julang or 'Giant Wave' nuclear submarine missiles. According to Global People magazine, the Dongfeng missiles are the first series of missiles completely built by the Chinese people and is the country's main weapon for national defence. Last month, Beijing reportedly mobilised its supersonic nuclear missile DF-26 after a U.S. destroyer sailed into the disputed waters in South China Sea. Days later, state broadcaster CCTV aired footage to show the missile being launched. DF-26 has been billed as the 'Guam Killer' by Chinese media as it's said to be capable of reaching Guam, a U.S. territory about 2,000 miles away from the Chinese coast. It's been hailed as Beijing's top weapon against Washington. CHINA'S OTHER MISSILES         China's DF-21 missile boasts a firing distance of up to 1,926 miles (3,100km) and has been dubbed 'the killer of aircraft carrier'.The missile is potentially capable of sinking a U.S. Nimitz-class aircraft carrier in a single strike, media have claimed.The DF-10 missile, on the other hand, is the best performing long-range cruise missile in the world, according to Chinese news site Sina.com.Sina said the 990-pound (450kg) weapon could strike a maximum distance of 1,242 miles (2,000km) and could reach Japan and Taiwan if it's fired from inland China.The DF-15B missile is an improved version of the original DF-15 missile and debuted in 2009 during the military parade to celebrate China's 60th National Day.The missile can reportedly travel at the speed of 2,000 metres (1.4 miles) per second and its striking accuracy is within 30 metres (98 feet).  China's Rocket Force is part the People's Liberation Army which handles the country's growing missile arsenal. The division was founded on January 1, 2016. It was renamed from the former Second Artillery Corps in the two-million-strong membership of the PLA. Commanders at the troop have claimed that their soldiers are 'ready to strike any targets at any time' under Beijing's order. Li Zhenglian, a brigade commander of the Rocket Force, told China Central Television Station in a previous interview: 'As long as there is an order, I am ready to bring out [soldiers] at any time, I can fire [missiles] at any time and I can strike [targets] accurately.'          DF-26 is reportedly capable of reaching the U.S. territory and sink aircraft carriers. The missiles are seen participating in a military parade at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 2015On its inauguration ceremony, the Chinese President Xi Jinping said the move to form the Rocket Force was a major decision made to 'realise the Chinese dream of a strong military'.The decision was also a 'strategic step to establish a modern military system with Chinese characteristics', said President Xi.Since coming to power in 2012, the Chinese President Xi Jinping has trumpeted building a stronger, combat-ready army.

53,"""Not natural friends"": Trump, Xi will be ""odd couple"" at first summit",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4377176/Not-natural-friends--Trump-Xi-odd-couple-summit.html," 21:53 BST, 3 April 2017 ","By David Brunnstrom, Matt Spetalnick and Ben BlanchardWASHINGTON/BEIJING, April 3 (Reuters) - When U.S. President Donald Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, their summit will be marked not only by deep policy divisions but a clash of personalities between America´s brash ""tweeter-in-chief"" and Beijing´s cautious, calculating leader.They may have one thing in common: their rhetoric about restoring their nations to greatness. But the two men differ in almost every other respect, from their political styles to their diplomatic experience, adding uncertainty to what has been called the world´s most important bilateral relationship.Five months after his election on a stridently anti-China platform, Trump appears to have set himself on a course for collision rather than conciliation with Xi, raising doubts as to whether the world's two biggest economies can find common ground.Topping the agenda at Trump´s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida will be whether he will make good on his threat to use crucial U.S.-China trade ties to pressure Beijing to do more to rein in its nuclear-armed neighbor North Korea, which is working to develop missiles capable of hitting the United States.Trump, a 70-year-old former real estate magnate with no foreign policy experience before entering the White House, has tweeted that it will be a ""very difficult"" meeting with the veteran Communist Party leader seven years his junior, given Chinese trade practices he says are killing U.S. jobs.He has also demanded that Beijing do more to ""solve"" the North Korean problem - his biggest national security challenge - or he will act alone to deal with Pyongyang´s nuclear and missile programs.Some White House aides believe Trump´s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner could be an influential moderating voice on how he handles Xi in their talks on Thursday and Friday. Contacts between Kushner and China´s U.S. envoy helped smooth the way for the meeting, according to current and former U.S. officials.Even so, what worries the protocol-conscious Chinese more than policy clashes is the risk that the unpredictable Trump could publicly embarrass Xi, after several foreign leaders experienced awkward moments with the new U.S. president.""Ensuring President Xi does not lose face is a top priority for China,"" a Chinese official said.U.S. presidents´ meetings with their Chinese counterparts are usually more tightly scripted than with other foreign leaders, something Chinese officials insist on to make sure they are treated with the decorum they believe befits a global power.This summit should offer a study in contrasts: Trump impatient, outspoken and prone to angry tweet-storms; Xi, outwardly calm and measured, with no known social media presence.Their shared nationalist tendencies could aggravate friction between their countries, which are increasingly global rivals.Trump insists the United States has been cheated economically for decades by countries like China and must regain its luster, while Xi wants China, once an ancient empire, to be able to flex its muscles on the world stage.""Xi and Trump are not natural friends,"" said a former senior U.S. official specializing in Asia. ""The question is when Trump´s `Make America Great Again´ hits Xi´s `Chinese Dream´, what´s the result?""WON´T PULL PUNCHESIt remains unclear how far Trump will go in translating populist rhetoric into policy that steps up pressure on China, given the risk of a trade war neither country can afford.But aides say he won't pull his punches, especially on trade, on which he has held an outspoken view for decades.This adds to doubts as to whether the two leaders can find common ground on North Korea and China's expansive claims in the South China Sea.Some analysts question whether Trump can get the better of Xi, who was born into a life of politics and has a reputation for being a tough tactician.""Xi´s performed pretty well in these types of environments,"" said Christopher Johnson, a China expert and former CIA analyst at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.While Trump has been in office little more than 10 weeks, Xi has honed his U.S. strategy since assuming the Chinese leadership in 2013.The son of a revolutionary leader, Xi has sought to project the image internationally of a strong advocate of globalization at a time when Trump has stoked fears of U.S. protectionism.Still, Chinese officials are mindful of the pitfalls if Trump veers off-script.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe found himself in a long, uncomfortable handshake at the White House in February, and Trump appeared to ignore German Chancellor Angela Merkel´s offer of a handshake during their meeting last month.An acrimonious call between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull caused particular concern in Beijing, officials there say.Still, the decision to hold a summit so early in Trump´s presidency suggests both Washington and Beijing see the value of trying to build a personal relationship between the two leaders.Trump goes into the meeting with significant gaps in his team of Asia advisers and his China policy still not fully formulated.Hardliners like trade adviser Peter Navarro, who authored a book ""Death by China,"" have feuded over the administration's approach to China with more pragmatic aides such as economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs president, current and former U.S. officials say.Administration officials argue Trump can use his ""Art of the Deal"" sales techniques to convince Xi that China needs the United States more than the United States needs China, especially when it comes to market access.But analysts say the Chinese are shrewd enough at geopolitics to fend off U.S. demands. Xi may also see Trump politically weakened by his high-profile legislative failure on healthcare as well as his low public approval ratings.Trump has already backed down on China's most sensitive issue - Taiwan - having first infuriated Beijing by suggesting he might not abide by Washington´s long-standing ""one China"" policy. Trump may now feel he is owed a favor in return.A fence-mending phone call in February was arranged by Kushner and China´s U.S. ambassador, Cui Tiankai, officials say, after Cui invited Trump´s daughter Ivanka to the Chinese Embassy's Lunar New Year reception, where her daughter sang in Mandarin.Both sides are keeping expectations low for tangible outcomes from the summit, billed as informal ""get to know you"" meetings similar to the 2013 Sunnylands summit in California between Xi and Trump´s predecessor, Barack Obama.And whatever else, unlike Abe's February visit to Mar-a-Lago, there will be no golf diplomacy: China´s Communist Party associates golf with shady dealings and has sought to stop officials from playing it as part of Xi's fight against corruption.

The Belt and Road Forum opening Sunday is the latest in a series of high-profile appearances aimed at projecting Xi's influence on the global stage ahead of a key congress of the ruling Communist Party later this year.

The ""Belt and Road Forum"" opening Sunday, May 14 is the latest in a series of high-profile appearances aimed at projecting Xi's influence on the global stage ahead of a key congress of the ruling Communist Party later this year. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)  Leaders from 28 countries are set to attend, including Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. The most prominent attendee from the West will be Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. Other Western nations, including the United States, will be represented by junior officials. Washington is sending a delegation led by Matt Pottinger, special assistant to the president and senior director for east Asia at the National Security Council. Britain, Germany and France are to be represented by finance officials. That's partly because of developments at home, but also is a reflection of concerns that China may be exporting its standards on human rights, the environment and government transparency, while leaving poor countries with unsustainable levels of debt. Yet the forum is as much about promoting Xi's image at home as it is about pushing his vision abroad. Chinese state media outlets have linked Xi inextricably to the two-day gathering in Beijing, which will revolve around Xi's plan for a vast network of ports, railways and roads expanding China's trade with Asia, Africa and Europe. Xi has even popped up in a series of English-language promotional videos produced by the official China Daily called ""Belt and Road Bedtime Stories."" ""He's showing vision. Leaders have to be visionary. He's showing hope in their economic future by proposing a very significant economic plan,"" former U.S. ambassador to China Max Baucus told The Associated Press. ""I think it's going to help him very much ahead of the next party congress."" The party will hold its twice-a-decade congress this fall at which Xi will oversee an infusion of fresh blood in leading bodies, most importantly the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee. Xi rose to the top of an intensely competitive system riven by factions and rivalries to take the reins of the party in 2012, and has steadily accrued powers well beyond those of his predecessors in areas such as defense, internal security and the economy. He's also fallen back on the hallowed tradition of political campaigns and sloganeering, preaching the ""Chinese Dream"" of prosperity and national rejuvenation, pushing a sweeping anti-corruption campaign and cracking down on the infiltration of ""Western"" democratic values that could threaten party control. In the international sphere, he's presided over both the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and the G-20 meeting of industrialized states, both of which were attended by former President Barack Obama. In January, Xi sought to portray himself as a champion of globalization and free trade at the World Economic Forum in Davos, in contrast to President Donald Trump's protectionist rhetoric. On an entirely different level though is his signature initiative formally known as ""One Belt, One Road."" It aims to reassert China's past prominence as the dominant power in Asia whose culture and economy deeply influenced its neighbors as far as Africa and Europe. It speaks deeply to Chinese pride in their country's explosive economic growth and political clout after a century of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers that formally ended with Mao Zedong's communist revolution in 1949. The initiative also furthers the Xi administration's reputation for muscular foreign policy. Under Xi, China has strongly asserted its claim to virtually the entire strategic South China Sea and established the Asian Infrastructure Development Bank as a global institution alongside the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and International Monetary Fund. And unlike APEC and Davos, it involves the disbursal of potentially trillions of dollars in contracts, expanding both China's economic reach and Xi's personal authority as holder of the purse strings. The ADB says the region, home to 60 percent of the world's people, needs more than $26 trillion of infrastructure investment by 2030 to keep economies growing. ""China has not just the resources now, which is key, but also the vision and desire and strategy to push its engagement outside its borders,"" Afghan Ambassador Janan Mosazai told the AP. A rail cargo link between China and Central Asia across the northern Afghan province of Balkh opened in August and the country is discussing possible Chinese investment in rail, hydropower and fiber-optic networks. Yet the initiative also comes with significant risks to Xi's stature and legacy. So far, it's been loosely defined and appears to be including more and more projects of peripheral importance and questionable value. Since so many of the states involved have weak economies and limited capacity for growth outside of mining, the potential for waste and corruption is high, raising the possibility of small returns on the vast sums being spent and massive losses for the Chinese state banks funding the projects. The initiative could also set back the goal of establishing a domestic economy centered on consumption rather than investment, warns political commentator Hu Xingdou. ""China's investment priority should be at home, not abroad,"" Hu said, adding that such forward-leaping overseas investments ""may delay domestic development."" Already, there is much discussion of Chinese foreign policy failures and economic losses in places such as North Korea, Sri Lanka and Venezuela, said Cheng, the Hong Kong scholar. ""It's easy to just give out money,"" Cheng said. ""China has to prove that these projects are sound and they have the management expertise to carry them through.""

President Xi Jinping Xi Jinping took control of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012 ©Aly Song (POOL/AFP/File) Xi's anointment, by the ruling party's top echelons after a key meeting in Beijing known as the Sixth Plenum, was met with fanfare by state media.A picture of the leader in a sombre Western suit dominated the front pages of the country's major papers Friday, and China's national broadcaster showed footage of Xi's lectures during the meeting on a near-continuous loop.A gushing editorial in the Communist Party's mouthpiece, the People's Daily, called the leader's elevation the ""common will"" of the nation, language echoed by commentaries in many major news outlets.The official Xinhua news service said the decision was a formal recognition of the critical role Xi has played since taking power in 2012, when he launched a massive anti-corruption drive that has shaken the party to its roots.While the campaign has led to the punishment of over a million officials, it, too, has raised questions about whether Xi is a reformer or is carrying out a ruthless political purge.The document that declared Xi's primacy also emphasised the importance of collective leadership and warned against the deification of the party's chiefs.""Propaganda about leaders should be factual and avoid flattery,"" it emphasised.- 'China's Washington' -The message appeared to have bypassed the denizens of China's social media, many of whom are thought to be by paid by authorities to lavish praise on the government.""Resolutely embrace Xi Dada!"" said one commenter, using a popular nickname for the leader that some say evokes an air of paternalistic authoritarianism.""With Xi Jinping as the core... we will definitely realise our Chinese dream,"" it continued, echoing the leader's nationalistic call for the ""Great Rejuvenation"" of the Chinese nation.The concept of a ""core"" leader was first put forward by China's former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1989, shortly after nationwide democracy protests turned into the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown.The situation was ""unstable"" at the time, said Xi Xianglin, a professor of political science at Beijing University, and Deng conferred the title on the country's new leader Jiang Zemin as a way to rally support.The term, he said, describes ""a virtuous person who comes to resolve differences of opinion within the party"".Many loyalists see Xi as a transformative figure, and Hu Xingdou, an expert on China's governance at the Beijing Institute of Technology, said his new status could see him become ""China's (George) Washington"" and lead the country ""out of the shadow of chaos"".The government had failed to deliver on its previous commitments in such areas as improving rule of law and opening markets, he said.""Conversely, they have been violated, and we have seen major setbacks.""Without a strong leader, he said, ""no one can make final decisions. Nothing can be accomplished"".Regional cadres began using the term ""core"" for Xi last December, but it then disappeared, suggesting that the Chinese president had encountered resistance to his efforts to further consolidate his power.The move comes ahead of a party congress next year when Xi will have an opportunity to put his own allies into the top Politburo Standing Committee.Jean-Pierre Cabestan of Hong Kong Baptist University said that calls for unity before and at the plenum showed that the party was ""far from being monolithic and that Xi is facing difficulties and even headwinds as far as his policy agenda is concerned"".""The battle for the next party congress has started but it is far from being over,"" he said.- 'Power hungry' -Not all are convinced Xi will use his new-found authority for good.He is a ""power hungry politician"", said Willy Lam, professor of politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.""It's what the psychologists call megalomania: the more powerful you are, the more power hungry you remain.""Lam believes that Xi will try to remain in power beyond the two five year terms allowed to the national president by law. There is no formal rule on tenure for the general secretary of the ruling party, the post from which he derives his power.""The core can ask for 20 years,"" he said. ""This is a very blatant building of the personality cult... a big step back for institutional reform.""Lam is not alone. For many, Xi's new title brings to mind an age-old tradition.One commenter on China's Weibo microblog service posted: ""One country, one emperor. It's the way it's been for thousands of years.""

Mr President. We have had no fewer than four prominent daughters and sons of Asia in our Parliament in the last three years, starting with Aung Sang Suu Kyi of Burma – the Nobel peace prize winner, democracy champion and international symbol of the innate human right of freedom.'Your visit here today, Mr President, reinforces the links between the United Kingdom and China. Those links are social and personal as well as economic and political and all the stronger for that.' 'This trip should provide the means for both sides to understand each other better, the Chinese people have many friends in this Parliament. Those friends are familiar with what you, Mr President, have described as the Chinese dream and what many others have referred to as a second Chinese revolution.'

You are attempting to complete an industrial revolution which took Britain the best part of two centuries in little more than two decades.'Your country has seen a transformation in how its people work and in what they rightly expect for themselves, for their families and for their society.         Addressing the house before inviting President Xi Jinping to speak, Mr Bercow pointedly described Burma's Ms Suu Kyi, who recently addressed both Houses of Parliament, as the 'champion of democracy'                  Twitter users who watched Mr Bercow's speech speculated that David Cameron may not have been happy with the Speaker's introduction of President Xi'The enormous challenge of how to deal with this, falls to you and your colleagues. Yet what China does economically, but also politically, is seen by and relevant to not merely your own citizens, it is seen by and relevant to billions more across the globe.'The world will be watching and waiting expectantly on the outcome as the emerging superpower takes its new place in the world.'    AUNG SAN SUU KYI: THE LADY OF BURMA AND WORLDWIDE ICON            Known as the Lady of Burma, 70-year-old Aung San Suu KyiKnown as the Lady of Burma, 70-year-old Aung San Suu Kyi is a democracy campaigner and the opposition leader in Myanmar and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.A military-drafted constitution bars her from becoming president of Burma, but she is one of the most powerful people in the country.Mother-of-two Suu Kyi was imprisoned by the former military dictatorship for 15 years for her attempts to bring down military rule in Myanmar, and became an international symbol of peaceful resistance in the face of oppression.  Addressing the audience in Parliament's Royal Gallery, Mr Bercow referred to 'the wise Chinese words' that 'it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness'.'We very much hope that your time here will assist the process of illumination,' he told Mr Xi.Mr Xi then addressed Parliament in Mandarin, describing Britain and China as becoming 'increasingly interdependent' parts of a 'community of shared interests'.In his 11-minute speech he told assembled peers and MPs that he believed his four-day State visit to the UK was helping to lift the friendly relationship between the two countries to 'a new height'.  Mr Xi said that the experience of giving his address in the historic Parliament gave him 'the feeling of going back in time'.He acknowleged that the British parliament was the oldest in the world, but added: 'In China, the concept of putting people first and following the rule of law emerged in the ancient times.' Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza told the president that offering an address to both Houses in the Royal Gallery was a 'rare tribute, which we reserve only for those we hold in the highest regard'. Mr Bercow's comments came after what was seen as a dig at the Chinese premier earlier today at the very moment the Queen was welcoming the Chinese President to London.He contrasted the four-day state visit by President Xi with a planned visit by the prime Minister of India, which he described as a 'great democracy'.The extraordinary intervention at a key moment in British-Chinese relations will cause deep embarrassment for the government which hopes to use the visit to secure billions of pounds in trade deals.The visit by President Xi has been dominated by claims the UK government is kowtowing to the Chinese and brushing concerns about human rights, cybersecurity and UK job losses under the red carpet to woo the world's second largest economy.But Mr Bercow's decision to criticise China's communist rule will trigger anger in Downing Street and comes just hours before President Xi is due to address both Houses of Parliament.During Foreign Office questions in the Commons today, Labour MP Keith Vaz asked about a visit to the UK next month by Inidian Prime Minister Narendra Modi which he said is the cause of 'huge excitement amongst the British-Indian community'.He said the visit should be used to 'send out a message that it is not just learning Chinese that is important and that a bit of Hindi will go down well in our bilateral relations'. He has long been an advocate of human rights across all continents and countries  John Bercow's spokesman Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire said he welcomed the visit, including plans for Mr Modi to address a huge event at Wembley Stadium.He added that he wanted to see more English language teaching in India.At this point Mr Bercow stood up and pointedly said: 'Of course the Indian Prime Minister is the representative of a great democracy.'He placed heavy emphasis on 'democracy' before calling the next MP to ask a question.Mr Swire was seen to be visibly irritated by the intervention, and there were audible intakes of breath in the Commons but Mr Bercow continued chatting to his clerks.A spokesman for Mr Bercow said: 'He said what he said.'Asked if the Speaker was pleased the red carpet was being rolled out for the Chinese President, the spokesman said: 'The Speaker frequently welcomes guests to address both Houses, on behalf of his Parliamentary colleagues.'Pressed on whether the comments were fuelled by concern about human rights in China, the spokesman added: 'He has long been an advocate of human rights across all continents and countries.'                As a four-day state visit by President Xi Jinping got underway, Mr Bercow contrasted it with a planned visit by the prime Minister of India which is a 'great democracy'         President Xi was escorted by the Duke of Edinburgh as he passed members of the Household Cavalry at Horse Guards ParadeIn December last year Mr Bercow was critical of the Chinese government after it refused to allow aa committee of MPs to visit Hong Kong.He branded the snub an 'extremely serious matter for which I can think of no exactly comparable precedent in my 17 and a half years in the House'.Before becoming Speaker, the Tory MP asked questions about executions and the use of the death penalty in China.In a debate in 2007, Mr Bercow said: 'If China wants to play a responsible role in the world, it must accept that it is incumbent on it so to behave in the international community as to demonstrate a greater respect for the human rights of other people.'And also an interest in the political and diplomatic priorities of the countries with which it wants both to do business in commercial terms and to establish decent political relations.'Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is expected to challenge President Xi on human rights at a private meeting this afternoon.Mr Cameron's former policy guru Steve Hilton wrote in the Mail today: 'Instead of standing up to a dangerous rogue state, we are bowing down before it.'By embracing the Chinese dictatorship, we bring national and moral dishonour.'

57,'Clock has run out' on North Korea warns White House as Trump's Mar-a-Lago summit with China's Xi Jinping to be dominated by crisis over Kim,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4381700/North-Korea-increasingly-focus-US-China-meeting.html," 08:29 BST, 5 April 2017 ","The White House is talking in more urgent terms about North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons, as President Donald Trump's talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping approach.One senior administration official warned that the 'clock has now run out' on Pyongyang.Trump and Xi will huddle Thursday and Friday at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, a venue chosen to give the summit a more informal feel. White House officials said Tuesday that trade and security would be high on the new American president's agenda, including pushing China to exert more economic pressure on North Korea.              Crisis: China's president Xi Jinping will arrive in the U.S. with increasing fears over his country's isolated neighbor North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-un         'Humanity problem': Trump issued a warning that North Korea was becoming a worldwide crisis ahead of his summit with the Chinese president Speaking at a White House business forum Tuesday, Trump called North Korea a 'humanity problem.' A White House official later said 'all options are on the table' for the U.S., though the official would not say what steps Trump was willing to take to curb Pyongyang's pursuit of a nuclear weapon.North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the waters off its east coast on Wednesday, U.S. and South Korean officials said, in a reminder of the simmering tensions on the Korean peninsula.Like many nations, China is still grappling with Trump's mercurial nature after the relative transparency and predictability of the bilateral relationship under Barack Obama. Both during his campaign and after his victory, Trump complained repeatedly about China's allegedly unfair trade practices, its perceived lack of assistance in reining in North Korea and its drive to cement control over the South China Sea.Some analysts believe Xi might be willing to hand Trump a symbolic victory on trade to put a positive spin on the meeting.'Xi probably can't accommodate Trump on sovereignty and security issues, but he has a lot of leeway on economics,' said Robert Sutter, a China expert at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.

Share this articleShare41 shares Yet even if Xi is able to offer Trump deliverables, he will still have to deal with 'a restless U.S. president valuing unpredictability and seeking advantage for his agenda going forward,' Sutter said.Trump was seen as moving trade even more to the forefront when he signed a pair of executive orders Friday focused on reducing the trade deficit. Coupled together, the orders appeared to be a symbolic shot at China, which accounted for the vast bulk - $347 billion - of last year's $502 billion trade deficit.While aides insisted the timing was coincidental, the administration touted the moves as evidence of an aggressive but analytical approach to closing a yawning trade gap that is largely due to the influx of goods from China.Still, Trump told the Financial Times newspaper that during his meeting with Xi, he doesn't 'want to talk about tariffs yet, perhaps the next time we meet.' A second White House official said Tuesday that the topic may come up, though there was not expected to be any resolution.The officials would only discuss the upcoming summit on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid pre-empting the president.Looming over the visit will be North Korea's nuclear provocations. China continues to oppose the tough measures demanded of it to address the issue, fearing a collapse of the Pyongyang regime would bring a crush of refugees and possibly U.S. and South Korean troops on its border.Trump told the Financial Times the U.S. is prepared to act alone if China does not take a tougher stand against North Korea's nuclear program.'China has great influence over North Korea,' he said. 'And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won't. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don't it won't be good for anyone.'                North Korea has fired a projectile into the East Sea just hours after it threatened to hit back if it was hit with tougher sanctions over weapons tests       Scrutiny: Trump's upcoming summit with China's leader will be closely watched for signs of how relations between the world's top two economies will proceed. It is the focus of huge interest in ChinaAdd to the mix the issue of the South China Sea, where Beijing has built and armed man-made islands despite the concerns of neighboring countries; and Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that China claims as its own territory, and which some in Trump's administration would like to see in a stronger relationship with the U.S.Despite such divisions, Beijing seems committed to establishing a positive relationship between the two leaders.'It is fundamental for them to improve understanding between each other,' said Xiong Zhiyong, a professor at Peking University's School of International Relations. 'Both sides have shown their willingness to cooperate and they are expected to make a commitment for cooperation.'China, Xiong said, realizes that Trump 'is a leader with a strong personality.'The White House said Trump and Xi would hold meetings and a dinner on Thursday, then gather again Friday for more discussions and a working lunch. First lady Melania Trump and Xi's wife, famed songstress Peng Liyuan, plan to attend the dinner.As personalities, Xi and Trump are a study in contrasts. A lifelong Communist Party apparatchik and son of a former vice premier, Xi has built his career with a cautious approach, avoiding controversial reforms and rarely speaking out in ways that would distract from his core message. His nearly five years as head of the ruling party have been defined by a campaign to achieve the 'Chinese dream' of increasing prosperity while tackling endemic corruption.Still, outwardly cordial relations with U.S. presidents are also a longstanding Chinese tradition, in recognition of the importance of the bilateral relationship. Xi had taken pains to appear at ease in the company of Obama, avoiding the rancor that characterized the relationship between the American leader and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

58,Xi term-limits controversy looms at China political meeting,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5459895/Unlimited-Xi-presidency-looms-China-political-gathering.html," 09:54 BST, 4 March 2018 "," BEIJING (AP) - The prospect of Chinese President Xi Jinping ruling indefinitely is dominating discussion as China's legislature opens its annual session Monday. The constitutional amendment to the two-term limit on the president underscores Xi's standing as China's most dominant political figure in decades. That's raised concerns about a return to the one-man rule of past dictators such as Mao Zedong and what that could mean for China's domestic politics and international standing, with some warning of the possibility of capricious policy making and greater political repression. The ruling Communist Party allows no public debate, although some have registered their opposition in social media posts. A look at some of the major issues on the table at this year's meeting of the nearly 3,000-member National People's Congress:          People walk past a propaganda billboard showing Chinese President Xi Jinping along a street in Beijing, Friday, March 2, 2018. The annual meetings of China's top legislative bodies are set to begin on Saturday, during which the two-term limit on China's presidency is expected to be removed. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)  ___ A POSSIBLE XI PRESIDENCY-FOR-LIFE The proposal to amend the constitution by lifting the limit of two consecutive terms for the president and vice president appeared without warning, even if few were surprised. Though it's expected to pass with near-unanimous approval, some complaints have arisen from independent political commentators and internet users posting online. One of the most popular images was of Winnie the Pooh - to whom Xi is said to bear a resemblance - hugging a pot of honey accompanied by the quote, ""Find the thing you love and stick with it."" Xi had seemed to signal his intentions to stay on beyond the traditional limit of two five-year terms as president and party secretary by declining to appoint an obvious successor at last year's Communist Party congress. ___ IMPLICATIONS FOR CHINA'S POLITICAL SYSTEM While seen as offering stability in the near term, the prospect of Xi as president-for-life has many worrying about his long-term intentions and a return to one-man rule in the style of the Chinese emperors or communist China's founder, Mao Zedong. Along with reviving fears of dictatorship, greater political repression and policy-making on a whim, the move undermines a decades-long push for greater institutionalization of the levers of power and strengthened rule of law. It also throws up questions about the future succession process and appears to scupper any chance for political liberalization to keep pace with China's increasingly individualistic society. On Sunday, the spokesman for the congress, Zhang Yesui, defended the constitutional amendment as necessary to ensure the unity of Xi's three top positions as president, leader of the Communist Party and head of the Central Military Commission. The move is ""conducive to uphold the authority of the (Communist Party) Central Committee with Xi Jinping at the core,"" Zhang said. ___ LOOKING LONG TERM By setting the stage to extend his rule by a decade or more, Xi seems to indicate that he believes he's the only one fit to see out his vision of turning China into a top innovative nation by 2035 and to realize his ""China Dream"" of a fully modern leading nation by midcentury. He's also eager to carry forward his campaigns to end corruption and abuse through the establishment of a National Supervisory Commission, to end poverty and continue turning the People's Liberation Army into the dominant military force in Asia. Other longer-term goals and prospects include eclipsing the U.S. as the world's largest economy and pushing it out of the Asia-Pacific power sphere, managing Hong Kong until its 50 years of semi-autonomy run out in 2047 and engineering reunification with Taiwan - either peacefully or by force. ___ TURBULENCE AHEAD China's embattled liberal intellectuals have universally panned the move. They've registered their opposition in brief postings on social media that have been heavily censored, comparing the situation to that of imperial China, North Korea or the Mao era. Though Xi, 64, has sidelined his opponents within the party elite, many rank-and-file members had come to believe in the institutionalized norms established during the era of reformist leader Deng Xiaoping and may find the possibility of Xi retaining a total monopoly on power for years or decades to come distasteful. Cheng Li and Ryan McElveen of the Brookings Institution wrote that some may see the removal of term restraints as ""heralding a return to an era of vicious power struggles - a zero-sum game in which they will also ruthlessly engage in the years to come."" Concerns have also been raised over the high-handed manner in which the amendment is being forced through, with little sign of a firm consensus in favor. There have been rumors of opposition from within the party even before its Feb. 25 announcement, which, in a highly unorthodox move, was first made in English on a Sunday afternoon. ___ INSTALLING KEY ALLY WANG QISHAN AS VICE PRESIDENT Xi appears intent on making the bold move on term limits with his trusted ally Wang Qishan alongside as vice president. Wang has been Xi's main enforcer in his trademark campaign against corruption, now well into its sixth year, and has helped take down potential rivals both retired and in office. Though Wang, 69, is past standard retirement age and stepped down from the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee last year, he retained his seat as a member of the National People's Congress and stands to transform the traditionally ceremonial role of vice president. That will further consolidate Xi's authority against Premier Li Keqiang and allies of former leaders Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, and shake up the status quo by which real power at the center derives almost exclusively from the Standing Committee. ___ NEW CABINET TO HANDLE SLOWING ECONOMY, OTHER CHALLENGES Along with the vice president, the congress will appoint a slew of Cabinet ministers and other top officials to oversee the running of the world's most populous nation and second-largest economy. Among their key challenges is an economy whose growth slowed to 6.8 percent last year, the loss of some 2 million jobs in the public sector, widespread environmental degradation and trade frictions with key partners the U.S. and EU. Having launched bold initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road initiative, China is now charged with maintaining that momentum in the face of doubts from the West and some reluctance on the part of participants. ___ TRUMP, NORTH KOREA POSE FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGES Along with China's growing international status, foreign relations weigh ever more heavily on proceedings at the congress. China's fraught relations with North Korea, its dispute with South Korea over missile defense and perennial sparring with the U.S. over trade and regional security are among the hot-button issues likely to be raised at the foreign minister's news conference held over the course of the congress. Beijing has also been put on the defensive over accusations that it is meddling in the affairs of other nations to squelch critical views of China and control the affairs of overseas Chinese communities. Xi's intention to rule indefinitely will ""enhance fear of the 'China threat,'"" Chinese law expert Gerome Cohen wrote in a blog posting for the Council for Foreign Relations. Xi's ""ever greater repression will make people think of Stalin's decades-long centralization of power,"" Cohen wrote.

Violators face a one-year ban on broadcasting such programmes, it added.Despite government controls, foreign television shows are widely available as illegal downloads or on pirated DVDs. Many are also available legally online through distribution deals with domestic websites.In 2013, China's General Administration for Press and Publication enforced similar orders to promote ""morality-building"", but it is unclear if the new rules will add to the barriers to foreign shows, or how many will be affected.Chinese officials often trumpet cultural reforms in a bid to widen the global reach of their country's culture and arts, and boost its soft power.Chinese media outlets have been expanding across the globe with state encouragement, aiming to offset negative images of the country that leaders feel are spread by world media.Visiting the offices of China's main news outlets in February, Xi said media must follow the party line, uphold the correct guidance on public opinion and promote ""positive propaganda"".Violators will be severely dealt with, Tian Jin, deputy head of the regulator, said in Sunday's People's Daily, the newspaper of the ruling Communist Party.""We must resolutely stop and seriously punish those behaviours in programmes that follow, and hype, heated social issues, ridicule national policy, spread wrong views, preach extreme ideas and intensify contradictions,"" Tian said.

60,THE BIGGER PICTURE: What Modi can learn from Xi ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2742475/THE-BIGGER-PICTURE-What-Modi-learn-Xi.html," 00:07 BST, 4 September 2014 ","Last month, Prime Minister Modi articulated the Indian dream in his extempore address on Independence Day. He packaged a deceptively large vision of the Indian future in penny-packets – a clean country with toilets for all, especially women, a country free of violence, again, especially against women, a manufacturing hub with a social safety net for all, and so on. Though he did dwell on moral corruption, he had little to say on monetary corruption, something which has plagued the nation for a long time, and which roiled the politics of the country for years leading to the UPA’s defeat and Modi’s spectacular election victory. Somehow, with the passage of the Lokpal Bill, the issue seems to have receded from public memory.          PM Modi and China’s leader Xi Jinping can share ideas on tackling corruptionCorruption Modi has coined the memorable slogan, “na khaunga, na khaney doonga” (loosely translated to “I will not be corrupt nor permit corruption”). There is little doubt he has tightened the governmental system and his ministers are on tenterhooks all the time, a function of the fact that their boss is not just first among equals, but their omniscient supremo. However, corruption is so widespread, that without tackling it on an institutionalised scale, it cannot be managed by a vigilant leader all by himself. Though, it must be pointed out there is no doubt there will be a positive trickle-down impact from a government which is honest at the top, just as it had worked the other way with the UPA. The one country that Modi can take lessons from is China. Both Modi and Xi are seeking to consolidate a vision of a nation with middle-class values, virtues and attainments, though they articulate it in different ways. A corruption-free and efficient government which provides a level playing field is the most desirable goal for middle-class folk. Perhaps Modi has wanted to avoid negativity in taking up corruption at this stage. But he cannot be unaware of the fact that corrupt police, administrators, judges and, above all, politicians, have made India the dystopia of poverty, filth, violence, illiteracy and joblessness. Across the country, at every level of government – chaprasis, policemen, junior engineers, and IAS officers – function in a corrupt system in symbiotic lock-step with our politicians. Beyond the venality of officials exists the criminalised society of new India, where mafias operate freely - real estate, sand-mining, coal, timber, liquor, drugs, even education, tent supplies and parking. These cannot be rooted out through ordinary means because they  have infiltrated the machinery of the state – the police and the governance system.The Lokpal movement of Anna Hazare seems to have lost its way. Modi himself has been ambivalent about the Lokpal, believing, presumably, that a revitalised administration will make this institution redundant. If so, he is wrong. At some point, he will have to take up the fight directly. Learning This is the lesson we can learn from Xi Jinping. From the outset, Xi has been involved in a struggle against corruption. In his first press conference on the first day he took over as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012, Xi announced corruption was ruining the CPC and the country. To fix this he got his aide Wang Qishan to take the post of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI). Through its draconian authority over the 91 million party members, the CCDI covers almost every aspect of the Chinese government and administration. Wang has launched a campaign to ensnare both “flies” (smaller functionaries of government) as well as the “tigers” (the high-ranking leaders). The CCDI and its associated Ministry of Supervision has investigated 182,000 officials in 2013 alone, the highest number in 30 years. Values As for the “tigers,” since about a year ago 28 ministerial and provincial-level senior leaders have been arrested, including four members (two full members and two alternate members) of the newly-formed 18th Central Committee. In their cross-hairs now are a former Poliburo Standing Committee Member, Zhou Yonkang, the highest ranking official to ever face action, a former Vice-Chairmen of the Central Military Commission Xu Caihou, who was also a Politburo member has been expelled by the party and is to be court-martialed, and another CMC Vice Chairman, Guo Boxiong, is under investigation.It would be easy to accuse Xi of using the anti-corruption campaign to consolidate his authority in China. But in taking on the top echelons of the party, he is taking a big risk. But, clearly, the idea of a corruption-free country is an intrinsic part of his “dream” because it will make for a more resilient China. Just as, of course, it would a corruption-free India. Modi, too, has articulated an dream of development and prosperity, but he needs to ensure that it is not distorted by corruption. W B Yeats once wrote, “In dreams begins responsibilities.” Hopefully, this is something that the leader of China Xi Jinping, and the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi understand well. Both have packaged their plans and perspectives as visions or dreams that spring from the positions of authority that they occupy. But both can be undone if somehow they are unable to deliver. The writer is a Contributing Editor, Mail Today and Distinguished Fellow, Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi "

Public anger is mounting over the issue, tourists are staying away and the Communist government is increasingly embarrassed.For the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting Beijing and neighbouring areas have imposed tight limits on car use, ordered factories to close, and given public-sector employees holidays.        Pedestrians cover their faces amid heavy Beijing smog on October 8, 2014. President Xi Jinping says he checks the city's pollution first thing every morning The result has been stunning skies popularly dubbed ""APEC blue"" by online commentators mocking their temporary nature. Even Xi himself used the phrase Monday.Levels of PM2.5 particulates, the smallest and most dangerous, fell to four micrograms per cubic metre last Thursday -- down from more than 400 during a period of heavy pollution last month. The World Health Organization's recommended maximum is 25.""These days the first thing I do in the morning is to check the air quality in Beijing, hoping that the smog won't be too bad so that our distinguished guests will be more comfortable while you are here,"" Xi said at a welcome banquet for leaders and spouses.""My hope is that everyday we will see a blue sky, green mountains and clear rivers, not just in Beijing, but all across China so that our children will live in an enjoyable environment,"" he told diners including his US and Russian counterparts Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin.Xi, the son of a revolutionary hero, is a Communist ""princeling"" fulfilling a Party destiny to lead the world's most populous country. But his comments are in line with what many believe are efforts carefully to build his image as a man of the people.Earlier this year, as pollution readings in the routinely smog-hit Beijing hit extreme levels, Xi decided to take a stroll -- without a facemask, but accompanied by television cameras -- in a popular shopping and cafe district.""Breathing the same air, sharing the same fate,"" said a widely shared online post.He described anti-pollution efforts Monday as ""a very important part of the Chinese dream"", a vague term with connotations of national resurgence which has come to define his lofty aspirations.""Some people call the clear Beijing sky these days the 'APEC blue', it is beautiful but temporary and it will be gone soon after the APEC meeting,"" Xi said in a candid admission.Users of popular mobile messaging app WeChat have defined the colour as ""something that is beautiful but fleeting and ultimately inauthentic"".

62,SPECIAL REPORT-How China is replacing America as Asia's military titan,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-6953173/SPECIAL-REPORT-How-China-replacing-America-Asias-military-titan.html," 02:11 BST, 24 April 2019 "," By David Lague and Benjamin Kang Lim HONG KONG, April 23 (Reuters) - In 1938, in the midst of a long campaign to bring China under Communist Party rule, revolutionary leader Mao Zedong wrote: ""Whoever has an army has power."" Xi Jinping, Mao's latest successor, has taken that dictum to heart. He has donned camouflage fatigues, installed himself as commander-in-chief and taken control of the two million-strong Chinese military, the People's Liberation Army. It is the biggest overhaul of the PLA since Mao led it to victory in the nation's civil war and founded the People's Republic in 1949. Xi has accelerated the PLA's shift to naval power from a traditionally land-based force. He has broken up its vast, Maoist-era military bureaucracy. A new chain of command leads directly to Xi as chairman of the Central Military Commission, China's top military decision-making body. Operational leadership of naval, missile, air, ground and cyber forces has been separated from administration and training - a structure that Chinese and Western defense analysts say borrows from U.S. military organization. See the interactive version: https://reut.rs/2Uzr9z4 The Chinese leader isn't just revolutionizing the PLA. Xi is making a series of moves that are transforming both China and the global order. He has abandoned reform architect Deng Xiaoping's injunction that China should hide its strength and bide its time. The waiting game is over. Xi's speeches are peppered with references to his ""Chinese dream,"" where an ancient nation recovers from the humiliation of foreign invasion and retakes its rightful place as the dominant power in Asia. The effort includes signature shows of soft power: Xi's multibillion-dollar ""Belt and Road"" program to build a global trade and infrastructure network with China at its center, and his ""Made in China 2025"" plan to turn the country into a high-tech manufacturing giant. But the boldest stroke is his expansion of China's hard power, through his remaking of the PLA, the world's largest fighting force. At the core of this vision of national renewal is a loyal, corruption-free military that Xi demands must be prepared to fight and win. His push to project power abroad was accompanied by a power play at home. Xi has purged more than 100 generals accused of corruption or disloyalty, according to the official state-controlled media. A raw demonstration of his authority came when state television broadcast a laudatory documentary series about the PLA, ""Strong Military."" In one scene in the 2017 series, an elderly man sits in a military court at a desk marked ""defendant,"" looking frail in a navy-blue civilian jacket. It is Guo Boxiong, a former general and the most senior officer convicted in Xi's purge. He reads his confession to charges of bribery from a sheaf of papers gripped in both hands. ""The Central Military Commission dealt with my case completely correctly,"" says Guo, who had once served as vice-chairman of the body. ""I must confess my guilt and take responsibility for it."" Guo was sentenced to life in prison. In a series of stories, Reuters is exploring how the rapid and disruptive advance of Chinese hard power on Xi Jinping's watch has ended the era of unquestioned U.S. supremacy in Asia. In just over two decades, China has built a force of conventional missiles that rival or outperform those in the U.S. armory. China's shipyards have spawned the world's biggest navy, which now rules the waves in East Asia. Beijing can now launch nuclear-armed missiles from an operational fleet of ballistic missile submarines, giving it a powerful second-strike capability. And the PLA is fortifying posts across vast expanses of the South China Sea, while stepping up preparations to recover Taiwan, by force if necessary. 'THE U.S. COULD LOSE' For the first time since Portuguese traders reached the Chinese coast five centuries ago, China has the military power to dominate the seas off its coast. Conflict between China and the United States in these waters would be destructive and bloody, particularly a clash over Taiwan, according to serving and retired senior American officers. And despite decades of unrivaled power since the end of the Cold War, there would be no guarantee America would prevail. ""The U.S. could lose,"" said Gary Roughead, co-chair of a bipartisan review of the Trump administration's defense strategy published in November. ""We really are at a significant inflection point in history."" Roughead is no armchair theorist: A retired admiral, as former Chief of Naval Operations he held the top job in the U.S. Navy until 2011. His alarm reflects a growing view across the American defense establishment. In their report, he and his colleagues issued a dire warning. The United States faces a ""national security crisis,"" principally arising from growing Chinese and Russian military power. ""U.S. military superiority is no longer assured and the implications for American interests and American security are severe,"" the panel concluded. It is clear that Xi wants to bring the era of U.S. dominance in Asia to an end. ""In the final analysis, it is for the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia, solve the problems of Asia and uphold the security of Asia,"" he said in a 2014 speech to foreign leaders on regional security. China's Ministry of National Defense, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and the Pentagon did not respond to questions for this article or detailed summaries of its findings. This account of Xi and the PLA - which despite the ""army"" in its name comprises all military branches - is based on interviews with 17 current and former military officers from China, the United States, Taiwan and Australia. Many would only speak on condition of anonymity. It draws on the accounts of Chinese officials and people with ties to the senior leadership in Beijing who have known Xi Jinping and his family for decades and are familiar with his career as he rose through the party and government bureaucracy. It also relies on Chinese government publications describing Xi's political thinking, his speeches and official documentaries showcasing his leadership of the military. In Washington, the world's pre-eminent military power is mobilizing to respond. After decades of seeking engagement in the expectation that Beijing would become a cooperative partner in world affairs, the United States is treating China as a strategic competitor bent on displacing it as Asia's dominant force. Largely in reaction to this challenge, Washington is boosting defense spending, rebuilding its navy and urgently developing new weapons, particularly longer range conventional missiles. It is expanding military ties with other regional powers, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Singapore and India. And it's conducting an international diplomatic and intelligence campaign to counter China's cyber-attacks, traditional espionage and intellectual property theft. This campaign includes efforts to contain the global reach of Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE Corp. The confrontation comes as the administration of President Donald Trump is waging a tariff war aimed at reducing China's massive trade surplus with the United States. However the trade conflict is resolved, a graver risk is the possibility that the deeper tensions could boil over into an armed clash between Beijing and Washington and its allies in the hotly contested maritime zones off the Chinese coast. UNEXPECTED RISE The rise of the PLA is not all Xi's doing. Long before he took power, the military had been transformed from the massive but rudimentary land force that swept Mao and his comrades, including Xi's father, to victory over the Nationalists in 1949. Decades of steep increases in defense spending paid for an arsenal of high technology weapons; millions of soldiers were demobilized. But corruption became endemic. Xi's two predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, were civilians who took office without a network of support among PLA brass. They fostered loyalty through patronage, pay rises and budget increases, according to Chinese and Taiwanese analysts and retired officers. Under the weak leadership of Hu in particular, they say, senior officers exploited their positions to siphon off money, particularly from the logistic and equipment budgets. Rank buying became rampant. The military hierarchy Xi inherited had become a law unto itself under Hu, according to Li Nan, a scholar of the Chinese military at the National University of Singapore. ""It was out of control, in a sense,"" said Li. ""Now the power is centralized in the hands of Xi Jinping."" Xi, a so-called princeling, grew up as a member of China's Communist Party aristocracy, even though his family suffered separation and persecution in Mao's chaotic Cultural Revolution. His late father, Xi Zhongxun, was a revolutionary military leader who became a top government official in the early years of Communist rule. He was later purged in Mao's upheavals, before emerging a key leader of China's market reforms in the 1980s. Xi's dramatic accumulation of power was unexpected. He took a low profile as he slowly worked his way up the Communist Party and state bureaucracy, according to multiple Chinese familiar with his early career. His first job out of university in 1979 was serving in a junior post as a uniformed aide to General Geng Biao, then minister of defense. Xi's official biography records this three-year posting as ""active duty."" In this role, he had access to classified military documents, including files on the 1979 Chinese invasion of Vietnam, according to sources with ties to the leadership. He had to memorize hundreds of telephone numbers and was not allowed to rely on a telephone book, in case it was lost or stolen, they said. He then began a series of provincial government and party postings. In these roles, his performance was relatively unremarkable. As governor of the southeastern Province of Fujian, for instance, he was obsessed with the bureaucratic routine of political study sessions where officials review Communist Party documents and speeches of senior leaders, according to people who knew him at the time. And he was far from universally popular. He finished last in elections for alternate members of the party's 200-strong Central Committee during the 15th Communist Party Congress in 1997. This nondescript record appears to have worked in his favor. During his period as China's paramount leader, President Jiang Zemin handpicked Xi for senior office because the younger man was perceived to lack ambition, according to sources with close ties to the Chinese leadership. Xi was also thought to be a pliable candidate because he lacked a power base, one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But as China's top leader, he has shown a willingness to impose radical change at the top of the party, government and military. ""When I talk to my mainland friends, they all say he is a risk taker,"" said Andrew Yang Nien-Dzu, former defense minister of Taiwan. ""You never know what his next move will be."" XI THE SOLDIER From the beginning, Xi's corruption purge and promotion of loyal officers made it clear he had big plans for the PLA. Then, in mid-2015, he cut 300,000 mostly non-combat and administrative personnel before launching a sweeping overhaul of the military structure. He broke up the four sprawling, Maoist-era ""general departments"" of the PLA that had become powerful, highly autonomous and deeply corrupt, said Li from the National University of Singapore. Xi replaced them with 15 new agencies that report directly to the Central Military Commission he chairs. He also scrapped the seven geographically based military regions and replaced them with five joint-service theater commands. These new regional commands, comparable to those that govern the U.S. armed forces, are responsible for military operations and have a strong focus on combining air, land, naval and other capabilities of the Chinese armed forces to suit modern warfare. Xi also promoted favored commanders, many of them officers he knew in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, where he served the bulk of his early career as an official, according to Chinese and Western observers of the PLA. Others hail from his home province of Shaanxi or are fellow princelings. At the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, Xi further tightened his grip over the top military leadership, paring the Central Military Commission from 11 members to seven and stacking it with loyalists. Xi knew most of them from Shaanxi and Fujian. As he burnishes his military credentials, Xi draws on his early service in uniform. In speeches to military audiences, he describes himself as a soldier-turned-official, according to reports in the state-controlled media. In distinctive PLA camouflage fatigues, cap and combat boots, he has overseen some of the biggest military parades since the 1949 Communist victory. In the most recent of these displays, Xi has taken the salute from the troops without sharing the podium with the usual line-up of fellow party leaders and elders. In a massive naval exercise in April last year, Xi boarded the guided-missile destroyer Changsha to review the Chinese fleet of 48 warships in the South China Sea. State-run television showed the navy commander, Vice Admiral Shen Jinlong, and navy political commissar, Vice Admiral Qin Shengxiang, standing to attention as they reported to Xi and saluted. Xi then gave the order for the exercise to proceed. Both navy chiefs are Xi protégés. Shen has been rapidly promoted under Xi, leapfrogging other, more senior officers, according to Chinese and Western analysts. Qin had worked closely with the Chinese leader in a top post in the Central Military Commission before his promotion in 2017 to his navy role, China's official military media reported. Xi was also in fatigues again in July 2017 at a massive military parade to mark the 90th anniversary of the PLA at the Zhurihe training ground in Inner Mongolia. He took the salute from the parade commander, General Han Weiguo, an officer who served in Fujian while Xi was a party and government official in the province. Han has enjoyed a meteoric rise under Xi, being promoted to command China's ground forces shortly after this parade. ""Xi Jinping is obsessed with military parades,"" said Willy Lam Wo-lap, a veteran observer of personnel movements in China's military and political elites and a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""He loves these demonstrations of raw power."" As part of Xi's martial image-building, the party's propaganda machine portrays him as the leader responsible for a decisive pivot in China's recovery from foreign conquest and colonial domination that began with the First Opium War in the mid-19th Century. In the opening scenes of the ""Strong Military"" documentary, Xi is shown boarding the guided missile destroyer Haikou at Shekou port on December 8, 2012, and sailing into the South China Sea for the first time since becoming party and military chief that year. As Xi looks to the horizon through binoculars, the narrator says: ""As the warship pierces the waves, Xi Jinping peers toward a vision obscured in the mist of history when, 170 years ago, Western powers came from the sea to open the door to China, beginning a bitter nightmare for ancient China."" The nightmare ends, according to the documentary, with the Communist victory under Mao and the periods of growing economic and military power under former leaders Deng, Jiang and Hu. With Xi in charge, the series shows, a heavily armed China is poised to recover its former glory. PRESSURE ON TAIWAN Propaganda aside, Xi is proving far more assertive than his most recent predecessors in employing China's new military power. In 2013, China began dredging and island-building in the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, an area in which Beijing has competing territorial claims with the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam and Brunei. Xi personally directed these moves, according to a July 2017 commentary in Study Times, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party's Central Party School. ""It is the equivalent of building a Great Wall at sea,"" the commentary said. Extensive fortification of these outposts, including missile batteries, means that China has virtually annexed a vast swathe of this ocean. Ahead of his May 30 appointment to head the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Philip Davidson told a Congressional committee that China was now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios ""short of war."" Xi is also stepping up military pressure on Taiwan, Japan and India. Alongside a massive arsenal of missiles capable of striking Taiwan, Chinese naval and air forces conduct increasingly complex exercises that regularly encircle the self-governing island. These exercises are designed to intimidate Taiwan and wear down its forces which must respond to these drills, according to some Taiwanese defense analysts. ""They are obviously applying a lot of coercive power over Taiwan,"" said Yang, the former Taiwan defense minister. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and is determined to bring it under mainland control. In response to questions from Reuters, Taiwan's Defense Ministry said it would continue to maintain surveillance and deploy aircraft and warships to ""ensure the safety of our nation's air and sea territory."" Chinese naval and air forces are also increasing the tempo of deployments, exercises and patrols through the Japanese island chain. Japan's annual military White Paper last year said China's ""unilateral escalation"" of activities around Japan was arousing strong security concerns. Japanese interceptors scrambled 638 times in the past year against Chinese aircraft, the government reported this month, up almost 30 percent from the year before. ""China has expanded and intensified military activities not only in the East China Sea, but also in the Pacific Ocean and the seas around Japan,"" the Japanese Defense Ministry said in response to questions from Reuters. ""These activities appear aimed at improving operational capability and bolstering China's presence."" Despite these assertive moves, there are still questions from inside the PLA about the capacity of Chinese forces to compete with the United States and other advanced military powers. In numerous published commentaries, Chinese officers and strategists point to the PLA's lack of experience in conflict, technological shortcomings and failure to introduce effective command and control. Xi's power grab and bold agenda also carry great risk for him personally, the party and China. There has been widespread speculation in China that the corruption crackdown in the military and a parallel purge of party and government officials is at least in part Xi's response to a vicious, behind-the-scenes power struggle. Rare evidence of this surfaced at a key gathering of top officials. On the sidelines of the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, Liu Shiyu, then China's chief stock market regulator, accused a group of senior officials deposed in the purge of plotting a coup, including the disgraced former military chief Guo Boxiong. Earlier, the official military newspaper hinted at similar accusations, without citing evidence. Guo, who was imprisoned on corruption charges, could not be reached for comment. The Chinese government has not commented further on this allegation. In bringing down so many powerful military and party leaders and their factions, Xi has made many dangerous enemies, say people with ties to the leadership. And steep increases in military spending will become more difficult to sustain if the growth of the debt-burdened Chinese economy continues to slow. Still, Xi shows no sign of toning down his drive to galvanize the Chinese military. On October 25, he toured the Southern Theater Command in the city of Guangzhou, the headquarters responsible for the contested South China Sea. State television showed Xi in fatigues and combat boots, striding through the command post with senior brass. Xi, state media reported, told officers to concentrate on ""preparing for war and combat."" (Reporting by David Lague in Hong Kong and Benjamin Kang Lim. Edited by Peter Hirschberg.)"

It is clear that Xi wants to bring the era of U.S. dominance in Asia to an end. ""In the final analysis, it is for the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia, solve the problems of Asia and uphold the security of Asia,"" he said in a 2014 speech to foreign leaders on regional security. China's Ministry of National Defense, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and the Pentagon did not respond to questions for this article or detailed summaries of its findings. This account of Xi and the PLA - which despite the ""army"" in its name comprises all military branches - is based on interviews with 17 current and former military officers from China, the United States, Taiwan and Australia. Many would only speak on condition of anonymity. It draws on the accounts of Chinese officials and people with ties to the senior leadership in Beijing who have known Xi Jinping and his family for decades and are familiar with his career as he rose through the party and government bureaucracy. It also relies on Chinese government publications describing Xi's political thinking, his speeches and official documentaries showcasing his leadership of the military. In Washington, the world's pre-eminent military power is mobilizing to respond. After decades of seeking engagement in the expectation that Beijing would become a cooperative partner in world affairs, the United States is treating China as a strategic competitor bent on displacing it as Asia's dominant force. Largely in reaction to this challenge, Washington is boosting defense spending, rebuilding its navy and urgently developing new weapons, particularly longer range conventional missiles. It is expanding military ties with other regional powers, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Singapore and India. And it's conducting an international diplomatic and intelligence campaign to counter China's cyber-attacks, traditional espionage and intellectual property theft. This campaign includes efforts to contain the global reach of Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE Corp. The confrontation comes as the administration of President Donald Trump is waging a tariff war aimed at reducing China's massive trade surplus with the United States. However the trade conflict is resolved, a graver risk is the possibility that the deeper tensions could boil over into an armed clash between Beijing and Washington and its allies in the hotly contested maritime zones off the Chinese coast. UNEXPECTED RISE The rise of the PLA is not all Xi's doing. Long before he took power, the military had been transformed from the massive but rudimentary land force that swept Mao and his comrades, including Xi's father, to victory over the Nationalists in 1949. Decades of steep increases in defense spending paid for an arsenal of high technology weapons; millions of soldiers were demobilized. But corruption became endemic. Xi's two predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, were civilians who took office without a network of support among PLA brass. They fostered loyalty through patronage, pay rises and budget increases, according to Chinese and Taiwanese analysts and retired officers. Under the weak leadership of Hu in particular, they say, senior officers exploited their positions to siphon off money, particularly from the logistic and equipment budgets. Rank buying became rampant. The military hierarchy Xi inherited had become a law unto itself under Hu, according to Li Nan, a scholar of the Chinese military at the National University of Singapore. ""It was out of control, in a sense,"" said Li. ""Now the power is centralized in the hands of Xi Jinping."" Xi, a so-called princeling, grew up as a member of China's Communist Party aristocracy, even though his family suffered separation and persecution in Mao's chaotic Cultural Revolution. His late father, Xi Zhongxun, was a revolutionary military leader who became a top government official in the early years of Communist rule. He was later purged in Mao's upheavals, before emerging a key leader of China's market reforms in the 1980s. Xi's dramatic accumulation of power was unexpected. He took a low profile as he slowly worked his way up the Communist Party and state bureaucracy, according to multiple Chinese familiar with his early career. His first job out of university in 1979 was serving in a junior post as a uniformed aide to General Geng Biao, then minister of defense. Xi's official biography records this three-year posting as ""active duty."" In this role, he had access to classified military documents, including files on the 1979 Chinese invasion of Vietnam, according to sources with ties to the leadership. He had to memorize hundreds of telephone numbers and was not allowed to rely on a telephone book, in case it was lost or stolen, they said. He then began a series of provincial government and party postings. In these roles, his performance was relatively unremarkable. As governor of the southeastern Province of Fujian, for instance, he was obsessed with the bureaucratic routine of political study sessions where officials review Communist Party documents and speeches of senior leaders, according to people who knew him at the time. And he was far from universally popular. He finished last in elections for alternate members of the party's 200-strong Central Committee during the 15th Communist Party Congress in 1997. This nondescript record appears to have worked in his favor. During his period as China's paramount leader, President Jiang Zemin handpicked Xi for senior office because the younger man was perceived to lack ambition, according to sources with close ties to the Chinese leadership. Xi was also thought to be a pliable candidate because he lacked a power base, one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But as China's top leader, he has shown a willingness to impose radical change at the top of the party, government and military. ""When I talk to my mainland friends, they all say he is a risk taker,"" said Andrew Yang Nien-Dzu, former defense minister of Taiwan. ""You never know what his next move will be."" XI THE SOLDIER From the beginning, Xi's corruption purge and promotion of loyal officers made it clear he had big plans for the PLA. Then, in mid-2015, he cut 300,000 mostly non-combat and administrative personnel before launching a sweeping overhaul of the military structure. He broke up the four sprawling, Maoist-era ""general departments"" of the PLA that had become powerful, highly autonomous and deeply corrupt, said Li from the National University of Singapore. Xi replaced them with 15 new agencies that report directly to the Central Military Commission he chairs. He also scrapped the seven geographically based military regions and replaced them with five joint-service theater commands. These new regional commands, comparable to those that govern the U.S. armed forces, are responsible for military operations and have a strong focus on combining air, land, naval and other capabilities of the Chinese armed forces to suit modern warfare. Xi also promoted favored commanders, many of them officers he knew in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, where he served the bulk of his early career as an official, according to Chinese and Western observers of the PLA. Others hail from his home province of Shaanxi or are fellow princelings. At the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, Xi further tightened his grip over the top military leadership, paring the Central Military Commission from 11 members to seven and stacking it with loyalists. Xi knew most of them from Shaanxi and Fujian. As he burnishes his military credentials, Xi draws on his early service in uniform. In speeches to military audiences, he describes himself as a soldier-turned-official, according to reports in the state-controlled media. In distinctive PLA camouflage fatigues, cap and combat boots, he has overseen some of the biggest military parades since the 1949 Communist victory. In the most recent of these displays, Xi has taken the salute from the troops without sharing the podium with the usual line-up of fellow party leaders and elders. In a massive naval exercise in April last year, Xi boarded the guided-missile destroyer Changsha to review the Chinese fleet of 48 warships in the South China Sea. State-run television showed the navy commander, Vice Admiral Shen Jinlong, and navy political commissar, Vice Admiral Qin Shengxiang, standing to attention as they reported to Xi and saluted. Xi then gave the order for the exercise to proceed. Both navy chiefs are Xi protégés. Shen has been rapidly promoted under Xi, leapfrogging other, more senior officers, according to Chinese and Western analysts. Qin had worked closely with the Chinese leader in a top post in the Central Military Commission before his promotion in 2017 to his navy role, China's official military media reported. Xi was also in fatigues again in July 2017 at a massive military parade to mark the 90th anniversary of the PLA at the Zhurihe training ground in Inner Mongolia. He took the salute from the parade commander, General Han Weiguo, an officer who served in Fujian while Xi was a party and government official in the province. Han has enjoyed a meteoric rise under Xi, being promoted to command China's ground forces shortly after this parade. ""Xi Jinping is obsessed with military parades,"" said Willy Lam Wo-lap, a veteran observer of personnel movements in China's military and political elites and a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""He loves these demonstrations of raw power."" As part of Xi's martial image-building, the party's propaganda machine portrays him as the leader responsible for a decisive pivot in China's recovery from foreign conquest and colonial domination that began with the First Opium War in the mid-19th Century. In the opening scenes of the ""Strong Military"" documentary, Xi is shown boarding the guided missile destroyer Haikou at Shekou port on December 8, 2012, and sailing into the South China Sea for the first time since becoming party and military chief that year. As Xi looks to the horizon through binoculars, the narrator says: ""As the warship pierces the waves, Xi Jinping peers toward a vision obscured in the mist of history when, 170 years ago, Western powers came from the sea to open the door to China, beginning a bitter nightmare for ancient China."" The nightmare ends, according to the documentary, with the Communist victory under Mao and the periods of growing economic and military power under former leaders Deng, Jiang and Hu. With Xi in charge, the series shows, a heavily armed China is poised to recover its former glory. PRESSURE ON TAIWAN Propaganda aside, Xi is proving far more assertive than his most recent predecessors in employing China's new military power. In 2013, China began dredging and island-building in the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, an area in which Beijing has competing territorial claims with the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam and Brunei. Xi personally directed these moves, according to a July 2017 commentary in Study Times, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party's Central Party School. ""It is the equivalent of building a Great Wall at sea,"" the commentary said. Extensive fortification of these outposts, including missile batteries, means that China has virtually annexed a vast swathe of this ocean. Ahead of his May 30 appointment to head the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Philip Davidson told a Congressional committee that China was now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios ""short of war."" Xi is also stepping up military pressure on Taiwan, Japan and India. Alongside a massive arsenal of missiles capable of striking Taiwan, Chinese naval and air forces conduct increasingly complex exercises that regularly encircle the self-governing island. These exercises are designed to intimidate Taiwan and wear down its forces which must respond to these drills, according to some Taiwanese defense analysts. ""They are obviously applying a lot of coercive power over Taiwan,"" said Yang, the former Taiwan defense minister. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and is determined to bring it under mainland control. In response to questions from Reuters, Taiwan's Defense Ministry said it would continue to maintain surveillance and deploy aircraft and warships to ""ensure the safety of our nation's air and sea territory."" Chinese naval and air forces are also increasing the tempo of deployments, exercises and patrols through the Japanese island chain. Japan's annual military White Paper last year said China's ""unilateral escalation"" of activities around Japan was arousing strong security concerns. Japanese interceptors scrambled 638 times in the past year against Chinese aircraft, the government reported this month, up almost 30 percent from the year before. ""China has expanded and intensified military activities not only in the East China Sea, but also in the Pacific Ocean and the seas around Japan,"" the Japanese Defense Ministry said in response to questions from Reuters. ""These activities appear aimed at improving operational capability and bolstering China's presence."" Despite these assertive moves, there are still questions from inside the PLA about the capacity of Chinese forces to compete with the United States and other advanced military powers. In numerous published commentaries, Chinese officers and strategists point to the PLA's lack of experience in conflict, technological shortcomings and failure to introduce effective command and control. Xi's power grab and bold agenda also carry great risk for him personally, the party and China. There has been widespread speculation in China that the corruption crackdown in the military and a parallel purge of party and government officials is at least in part Xi's response to a vicious, behind-the-scenes power struggle. Rare evidence of this surfaced at a key gathering of top officials. On the sidelines of the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, Liu Shiyu, then China's chief stock market regulator, accused a group of senior officials deposed in the purge of plotting a coup, including the disgraced former military chief Guo Boxiong. Earlier, the official military newspaper hinted at similar accusations, without citing evidence. Guo, who was imprisoned on corruption charges, could not be reached for comment. The Chinese government has not commented further on this allegation. In bringing down so many powerful military and party leaders and their factions, Xi has made many dangerous enemies, say people with ties to the leadership. And steep increases in military spending will become more difficult to sustain if the growth of the debt-burdened Chinese economy continues to slow. Still, Xi shows no sign of toning down his drive to galvanize the Chinese military. On October 25, he toured the Southern Theater Command in the city of Guangzhou, the headquarters responsible for the contested South China Sea. State television showed Xi in fatigues and combat boots, striding through the command post with senior brass. Xi, state media reported, told officers to concentrate on ""preparing for war and combat."" (Reporting by David Lague in Hong Kong and Benjamin Kang Lim. Edited by Peter Hirschberg.)"

Chinese President Xi Jinping has described the Communist Party as a ""magic weapon"" that can be used to implement reforms necessary to achieve his goal of the ""Great Rejuvenation"" ©Johannes Eisele (AFP) The dry rhetoric hides what may be a ferocious, high-stakes battle for control over the world's second largest economy.The Sixth Plenum, as the meeting is known, comes as the party -- which has more than 88 million members -- faces a period of tectonic change.Since taking its helm in 2012, General Secretary Xi Jinping has sought to bend it to his will, and taken control of more levers of power than any leader since Mao Zedong.And his anti-corruption campaign has laid waste to the party's organisational chart, felling seemingly invincible bastions of power such as former security czar Zhou Yongkang, and paralysing lesser bureaucrats across the nation with fear.Xi has described the party as a ""magic weapon"" that can be used to implement reforms necessary to achieve his goal of the ""Great Rejuvenation"" of the Chinese nation, an idea that he frequently describes as the ""Chinese dream"".But attempts to rein in sclerotic state-owned enterprises -- which control strategic sectors of the economy and are sources of patronage for powerful politicians -- have met stiff resistance from entrenched interests.""These reforms have really gone nowhere over the last three years,"" said Anthony Saich, an expert on Chinese politics at Harvard University.""Clearly, Xi sees the party as the only vehicle that can push ahead with reforms. He does not trust society or the state to move ahead with the reforms he wants.""At the meeting, he added, ""there will be jockeying between those who enjoy Xi's support and those who are negatively affected by the campaign against corruption and by the potential for further reforms of the state-owned sector"".- Anti-corruption campaign –For Xi, improving party discipline means more than simply reducing cadres' bad behaviour.""He has been very ambitious in grabbing power, in arrogating powers to himself,"" said Willy Lam, a China expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.The ""major motivation"" of any new rules passed during the plenum will be to ""consolidate (Xi's) position as the big boss"", he said.Several measures have already been introduced to make sure party members toe Xi's line, he added, including prohibitions against officials making ""groundless criticism"".""Only one person in the party, namely Xi Jinping, has the right to define what the political rules are,"" Lam added.The meeting comes as speculation mounts that Xi could look to stay on in power after 2022, when he would normally be expected to step down after two terms in office.Such a move would be ""an extremely risky proposal, as it would create severe frictions among China's political elite"", the Mercator Institute for China Studies' president Sebastian Heilmann wrote in a research note.Xi is also China's president, but derives his power from his Communist Party post.He will take the plenum as an opportunity to ""strengthen his leadership position and the base of his power in office"", according to Mao Shoulong, a professor at Renmin University in Beijing.The anti-corruption drive has had ""breakthroughs"" in previously untouchable areas, he said.But its effectiveness may have conversely weakened the party Xi hopes to save, according to a Friday editorial about the Sixth Plenum posted on the web site of ""Seeking Truth"", an important party journal.The campaign has disciplined hundreds of thousands of members and, in the process, ""illuminated the universality and seriousness of the corruption of power within the party"", it said, a revelation that has ""seriously weakened the foundations of the party's rule and its ability to govern"".Critics say the drive has been used for internal faction-fighting and, in the absence of systemic reforms, does not tackle the root causes of graft.Hu Xingdou, an expert on China's governance at the Beijing Institute of Technology, hoped the meeting would introduce and enforce rules to make party members more accountable and transparent, such as a national property registry.""There have been regulations in the past, but none of them were implemented,"" he said.This time, he said, ""I hope that they can pass public disclosure of assets.""Only in this way can they win the entire nation's respect.""

Look closer, though, and things aren't so tidy: Growth is slowing, ethnic and political unrest persist — including an unprecedented protest movement in Hong Kong. And relations with China's neighbors are dogged by conflicts over territory and history.— HOW WELL HAS XI CONSOLIDATED HIS POWER?Two years after taking charge of the ruling Communist Party, Xi is considered the most commanding Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping at the height of his powers in the 1980s.

As he hosts President Barack Obama and other world leaders, China¿s President Xi Jinping appears firmly in charge of a vast but stable communist state boasting the world¿s second-largest economy. (AP Photo/Xinhua, Huang Jingwen, File) NO SALES Unlike his predecessor Hu Jintao, Xi has taken firm control of the military and has wielded his authority over the vast bureaucracy with an anti-corruption campaign that already has netted a retired top general and a former member of the party's all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee. Xi also has set up a commission to oversee the various state security bodies, with him at its head.Political dissent has been muzzled and relatively robust job creation and low inflation are keeping discontent in check for now. That's allowed him to push his notion of a ""Chinese Dream"" that envisions development and prosperity without democracy or Western-style freedoms.Showing his confidence, Xi's smiling face beams from the cover of a newly published book of his collected speeches, entitled ""The Governance of China,"" copies of which were laid out on a table at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit's media center. It's unusual to see such a publication issued for a Chinese leader still in office.— WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES?Over the past three decades, the party has maintained its authority largely on the back of ensuring economic growth and a better quality of life for China's 1.3 billion people. That's now starting to become more difficult, with the economy set to grow by about 7.5 percent this year, the slowest level in five years and well below the double-digit peaks of the last decade. It's not clear what effect that will have on employment and social unrest, although many wealthy Chinese have already taken up residency abroad in search of stronger legal protections and a better future for their children.China is also shifting from a labor-intensive model to one based on services, and the government needs to generate enough high-quality jobs or risk losing support from the burgeoning ranks of college graduates. Urbanization and industrialization have meanwhile produced massive environmental woes, including choking air pollution in Beijing and other cities. Fixing the problem will take decades.— WHAT ABOUT THE PARTY'S POLITICAL OPPONENTS?Xi has significantly tightened the screws on China's embattled dissident community and on people and groups operating outside the party's control. Many leading dissenters, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, are in prison and others face intense police monitoring, including forms of unofficial house arrest. Yet many Chinese continue to speak out over social and political concerns, requiring the government to maintain a vast internal security apparatus.The government's heavy censorship of online content puts it at odds with the expectations of a younger generation exposed to Western models of free expression.More worryingly, unrest continues among the Tibetan and Uighur minority populations in western China, breaking out into sporadic acts of violence. Six years after anti-government riots, much of Tibet remains closed to outsiders and a string of self-immolations underscores the level of discontent. Despite a smothering security presence in the Uighur homeland of Xinjiang, scores have been killed in attacks by radicals inspired by global jihadi movements.—HOW HAS XI REACTED TO HONG KONG'S PROTESTS?The central government has repeatedly denounced the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong started by students in September following Beijing's refusal to allow open nominations for the territory's chief executive in 2017 elections. While Xi has been mostly silent about them, he told Hong Kong's leader that he expects the territory's government to maintain law and order.The demonstrations have upended perceptions of the special administrative region's population as apolitical, and dented its image as a cozy place for doing business. So far, authorities are holding off on attempts to break up the protests, although that may change once APEC is over.Xi's attitude toward Hong Kong is having knock-on effects in Taiwan, the self-governing island that China also claims as its territory. Xi appeared tone deaf when he met with pro-unification activists in Beijing at the height of the Hong Kong crisis, telling them the ""One-China, Two-Systems"" formula being applied to Hong Kong was also the best way to bring Taiwan into the fold.— WHAT ARE THE FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGES?Xi inherited a China that is rapidly expanding its diplomatic and military reach abroad and is determined to play a bigger role in regional and global affairs commensurate with its economic clout.Yet, his pledge never to back down over China's core interests has exacerbated long-standing tensions over claims to waters and island groups. China is locked in a dangerous standoff with Japan over a cluster of uninhabited East China Sea islands and relations with Vietnam nosedived this summer after a Chinese state oil company moved a giant drilling platform into waters claimed by both sides. Anti-Chinese riots broke out and tensions continued until China removed the rig.Beijing's assertive behavior is also driving the redeployment of U.S. Navy vessels to the region, along with strengthened American military ties with the Philippines, Australia and even former foe Vietnam.— HOW WELL IS XI COPING?Xi gravitates toward hard-line positions and his attempted fixes have produced mixed results.While corruption is a major source of public anger and cynicism, the secretive nature of Xi's campaign is fueling impressions that the targets are being chosen for political reasons. Meanwhile, the structural reforms needed to curb graft, such as requiring officials to publicly declare their assets public or appointing independent investigators outside party control, have been left undone or discouraged.However, Xi has tried to dial down some of China's tensions with its neighbors, particularly Vietnam. He's expected to use the APEC summit on Monday and Tuesday to further soothe some of those hard feelings. He met Monday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is despised in China for his right-wing views, after more than two years of tension over the disputed East China Sea islands called Daiyou in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese.___EDITOR'S NOTE: Christopher Bodeen has covered China for The Associated Press for 14 years.

70,THE BIGGER PICTURE: 'Chinese dream' will haunt the new world as leadership transition tells world what the country is all about,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2294590/THE-BIGGER-PICTURE-Chinese-dream-haunt-new-world-leadership-transition-tells-global-community-country-about.html," 01:37 BST, 17 March 2013 ","THE BIGGER PICTURE: 'Chinese dream' will haunt the new world as leadership transition tells world what the country is all about By Manoj Joshi   Published: 01:37 BST, 17 March 2013  |  Updated: 01:41 BST, 17 March 2013                e-mail          View  comments    On Saturday, China completed the process of its once in- a-decade leadership transition. It has been one of the smoothest transitions of leadership in recent decades. Xi Jinping, who was elected General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chairman of its Central Military Commission in November, has taken over as the President of the country, along with a new prime minister Li Keqiang and a council of ministers. In taking over the three offices in such quick time, he has emerged as the most powerful Communist party boss since Deng Xiaoping.       He has wasted little time in consolidating his authority. No doubt circumstances, notably the Bo Xilai affair and other corruption scandals have aided the process. Though his first tour to the southern, economically vibrant zones, including Shenzhen was aimed at signaling his commitment to economic growth and reform, his most significant actions so far seem to have been in stamping his authority over the crucial pillar of the CPC - the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the country's national security policy. It was in this tour that he delivered a speech to senior PLA brass and party officials, where he stressed the need for ""absolute loyalty"" of the PLA to the CPC. Many western analysts have been pointing to the signs of the growing importance of the PLA and the role that it has played in the factional politics of the Chinese leadership. In the four months that Xi has been in power, he has undertaken a largescale reshuffle of the top leaders of the PLA general staff departments, as well as the seven military regions. Last month, the military authorities issued ""Ten Regulations on improving the Work Style of the Army"", aimed at checking corruption and high living among the mid and senior level officers. Among its more draconian prescriptions is the banning of liquor from public functions. Senior officers have been asked not to talk out of turn, and get clearance from the Central Military Commission General Office before commenting on sensitive issues to the media.

PARALLAX VIEW: Bollywood is on a safe sequel spree      Share this article Share   Of greater significance, perhaps, was Xi's January visit to the Guangzhou Military Region - the one that fronts the South China Sea. According to observers, it was significant that the Chinese media described it as the Guangzhou ""war theatre"" rather than the ""military region"" that it is. It was during this visit that the new General Secretary emphasised his requirements of the PLA, ""We must ensure that our troops are ready when called upon, that they are fully capable of fighting, and that they must win every war"". This has rung alarm bells across the region because it breaks away from the anodyne statements that leaders make about the need for ""readiness"" in the armed forces, or their duty to ""defend national interests."" All this has generated unease and indeed fear, among China's neighbours, particularly Japan. In recent months, China has stepped up pressure on the Senkaku islands, which it claims. There has been an increase in Chinese air and sea activity in the seas around the islands, which are currently under Japanese control. Japan is a useful target for Chinese nationalism. Given the history of the Japanese military invasions and atrocities, it is fodder to the ultranationalist forces in China. Indeed, it was in the 1894-95 invasion of the country that Japan is alleged to haveto the post of the head of the CPC, Xi was given charge of the top interagency group, which had been oversee China's maritime disputes. So it is not without significance that it is since Xi took charge that the Chinese have been active in the Senkaku area. But Japan is not the only target. In November 2012, China issued new regulations, effective January 1, which would allow the police of the Hainan prefecture to board and search ships, which in the Chinese views, were trespassing in their waters in the South China Sea. This is bringing China's other neighbours in the region into a zone of tension. But the country most affected could be the Philippines. But, both Japan and the Philippines could well be proxy targets because they are tied with the United States through Mutual Defence treaties. The Chinese are playing this carefully. In December, they took their claims to the continental shelf of the east China sea (which affects the Senkaku islands) to the United Nations. But it is the Philippines that is proposing arbitration on the South China sea. Whatever be the case, the bottom line here is that China has a new and vigorous leader who has made it clear that he is determined to outdo his predecessors and fulfill the ""Chinese dream"". What kind of a world view constitutes that dream is not yet clear. But it has important consequences for peace, tranquility and prosperity of the world. By ratcheting up tension, they are also causing alarm in other countries that use the busy South China Sea as the shortest and most convenient link between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The Chinese could well end up the losers as the countries affected could band together to offset Chinese aggressiveness. Worse, it could well trigger off Japanese nationalism and rearmament. In great measure, this depends on whether the hard edge in Xi's positions are postures linked to a domestic debate within the party and the PLA, or they are what they say they are: an announcement that the world better get used to Chinese power.

72,China may mandate prison for disrespecting national anthem,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5034277/China-mandate-prison-disrespecting-national-anthem.html," 05:54 BST, 31 October 2017 "," BEIJING (AP) - China's legislature is considering a bill mandating prison sentences of up to three years for disrespecting the national anthem, amid rising nationalist appeals from the ruling Communist Party under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. The move reported Tuesday by state media follows Xi's appointment to a second five-year term as party leader, for which he has designated as a central motif of realizing the ""Chinese Dream"" of a powerful, prosperous nation. Since taking office in 2012, Xi has established a growing cult of personality that leans heavily on his image as a patriotic leader who brooks no slight to national dignity. Hallmarks of his term in office have included a stronger military, bolder foreign policy and aggressive economic expansion abroad, as well as sharply reduced space for criticism or political dissent at home.

China's legislature is considering a bill mandating prison sentences of up to three years for disrespecting the national anthem, amid rising nationalist appeals from the ruling Communist Party under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)  The original draft legislation proposed in August called for 15 days in jail for infractions such as playing the anthem on occasions deemed improper, including funerals, or for changing its wording or presenting it in a disrespectful manner. Settings at which the anthem can be played include political gatherings, award ceremonies, flag-raising ceremonies, important diplomatic occasions and major sport events. The modified bill was submitted to the standing committee of the National People's Congress, which began its bi-monthly meeting on Monday, the Xinhua News Agency reported. The anthem, ""March of the Volunteers,"" has occasionally been a political flashpoint in Hong Kong, where tension is rising over mainland China's growing influence Soccer fans in the Chinese semiautonomous region have booed the anthem when it's played at games between the home team and teams from China or other countries, leading to fines from FIFA, the sport's governing body. Pro-democracy activists and lawmakers fear a national anthem law could be used to undermine freedom of speech in Hong Kong, which has a separate legal system from the mainland. Controversy has swirled for months in the U.S. about athletes, particularly those in the National Football League, kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism and police killings of African-Americans. President Donald Trump has lambasted such displays as disrespectful to the country's military and national symbols and urged team owners to fire players taking part. In a ruling last year, India's Supreme Court demanded that all citizens stand when the country's national anthem is played. The court also ruled that movie theaters must resume a tradition of playing the anthem before any film, and said all those present ""must stand up in respect."""
73,How can Xi speak of a 'Chinese Dream' and a 'Peaceful Rise' while threatening those who dare oppose China?,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-4762370/Can-Xi-speak-Chinese-Dream-Peaceful-Rise.html," 22:51 BST, 4 August 2017 ","You shall be unswervingly loyal to the absolute leadership that the party has over the army, heed the call of the party, follow the party,' asserted chairman Xi Jinping, while officiating a mega parade at the Zhurihe Combined Tactics Training Base in Inner Mongolia on the 90th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).Images showed a martial Chinese President, also chairman of the Central Military Commission - the most powerful organisation in the Middle Kingdom - dressed in combat fatigues, driving in an open jeep and inspecting around 12,000 combat troops.Xi told the PLA to be prepared for the battle and to defeat 'all enemies that dare to offend' China. Was it India, who had dared to challenge the mighty PLA when Beijing tried to change the status-quo at the tri-junction between Tibet, Bhutan and Sikkim, the target?         It has been decades since China last fought a war and the country insists it has no hostile intent, and simply needs to defend itself. However it's increasingly assertive stance in the South China Sea has rattled its neighbours          A formation soldiers from the PLA's Rocket Force, which controls the nation's arsenal of nuclear and conventional ballistic missiles, shout pledges of loyalty during the parade, which are part of the celebrations of the 90th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army   According to The South China Morning Post, 'Xi didn't specify any target', though the defence ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang stated that the parade was not targeted at China's 'surrounding situation', it was 'in accordance with the yearly training schedule.'MilitaryZhurihe is China's largest and most advanced military base. It was the first time that such a military parade was held outside Tiananmen Square in Beijing.'It differed from previous events in its heavy emphasis on combat and field operations,' noted the Hong Kong newspaper.It was indeed a huge display of military power; Xinhua reported that 40 per cent of the weapons on show had never before been seen by the public. Xi told the troops: 'You shall extend the battleground to wherever the party points. The world under heaven is not at peace, and peace needs safeguarding.'         China's military has undergone an extensive modernisation programme, cutting thousands of troops while investing heavily in modern technology, including drones, stealth fighters, nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers          Unlike previous parades seen in Beijing, the troops in Inner Mongolia were clad in full combat gear, to further emphasis their readiness. It was also the first time that President Xi had reviewed troops in such a wayHe added: 'We are closer than ever to realising China's great dream of national revitalisation and building a strong people's army.'There is a contradiction here, which might become a problem for Xi.Can Xi speak of a 'Chinese Dream' and a 'Peaceful Rise' while threatening to go to war against those who dare oppose China?A war would undoubtedly take China 50 years back in development.The PLA, in the meantime, continues to take giant steps towards the future. At the beginning of 2016, Beijing under-took in-depth reforms of its defence forces, aiming at a far wider 'integration'.Apart from the traditional three 'services' - the PLA's Army, Navy and Air Force - the PLA now has a Rocket Force (formerly, the second artillery) and a Strategic Support Force (SSF), which could be game changing.It could be a critical organisation for dominance in space, cyber and electromagnetic domains.China is looking into the future.          Missile launchers, self-propelled artillery and transport helicopters stand on display behind  the formations of troops. Xi said the Chinese military had the capabilities to 'preserve national sovereignty, security and interests'          Chinese Type 99 tanks parade, followed by elite airborne troops in helicopters above. The march took place at the remote Zhurihe training base in inner Mongolia, which is Asia's largest military training centre. The Chinese military said the parade had been planned for some time, and was not related to the current tensions in North KoreaMissileChina's military modernisation will include the ability to attack at long ranges any adversary forces that may deploy or operate within the Western Pacific Ocean.An array of weapons, like different types of missiles such as the new HQ-19 missile -which are specifically used to intercept ballistic missiles mid-course - are being developed.China is also working on an unmanned combat aerial vehicle named the 'Black Sword', which could compete with the best US drones. But there are other aspects that one can't ignore.Not all is rosy in China today.According to a blog on the People's Daily website, on July 26 and 27, the days before Xi met the National Security Advisors of the BRICS, a seminar was held in Beijing and the purpose was to 'unify the understanding among Party members'. Chinascope, a website which publishes translations and analysis of the Chinese media, pointed out that the meeting was different this year: 'First, the seminar location was changed from the Party School to the Jing Xi Hotel'.This hotel, closed to foreigners, is located near the Military Museum and Defence Ministry and is run by the PLA's General Staff Department. Why was the venue changed? Is Xi more 'secure' under the PLA wings?         Divisions on display: Up to 12,000 troops, 570 vehicles and 129 jets participated in the parade. State media reported that it was the first time that 40 per cent of the vehicles had been presented, which highlighted China's massive military spending       ChallengesIt was also different due to the large participation of party cadres; it included the seven members of the Political Standing Committee, provincial party bosses, top leaders from central government, representatives of the People's Congress, the judiciary and of course, the PLA.A telling detail: No paper and no pens were seen on the tables. In his speech, Xi said he was 'aware of the challenges': 'The world is undergoing a dramatic change while China is facing serious challenges.'How do we deal with the complexity of the world and gain control on the international stage? How can we seize the opportunity and break through conflicts and risks as China enters a critical development stage?'How can the party overcome the tests and risks and continue to be the leading party of the country? These are the important questions the party members should answer.'       In the next few days, the leadership will move to the seaside resort of Behaide. It doesn't mean things will be less steamy. The battle for the 19th Congress seems to have started.The PLA is bound to play a crucial role in the power struggle at the top of the party. We'll have to wait for a few months to see which way the smoke blows.Meanwhile, the PLA, 90 years after its foundation, seems much behind its chairman. The confrontation in Dokalam should be seen in this perspective.The writer is expert on China and Tibet"
74,Likely candidates for promotion to China's power apex,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4972686/Likely-candidates-promotion-Chinas-power-apex.html," 07:45 BST, 12 October 2017 "," By Benjamin Kang Lim and Ben Blanchard BEIJING, Oct 12 (Reuters) - President Xi Jinping of China is expected to place trusted allies in the Communist Party's apex of decision-making, the Politburo Standing Committee, during a reshuffle next week, according to multiple Chinese sources and foreign diplomats. A key measure of Xi's power will be how many of his allies are installed on the Standing Committee at the 19th Party Congress, which starts Oct 18. The body is currently made up of seven men and headed by Xi, who is also party chief. At least four members are slated to retire due to an unwritten rule limiting new five-year terms to those under 68. A fifth member who is a close Xi ally, the anti-corruption tsar Wang Qishan, 69, could remain. The new line-up will be announced at the first plenum of the Congress, around Oct. 25. The State Council Information Office, which acts as the spokesman's office for the cabinet and party, did not respond to a request for comment on Standing Committee candidates. Here is the list of the most likely candidates, all men, for promotion to the Standing Committee (surnames in alphabetical order): - Cai Qi, 61, has enjoyed a meteoric rise under Xi and is considered a shoo-in for the 25-strong Politburo after he was named party boss of Beijing in May. He is a dark horse to catapult to the Standing Committee. Cai overlapped with Xi during the latter's 17-year stint in the southeastern province of Fujian and in the eastern coastal province of Zhejiang, where Xi was party boss from 2002 to 2007. Cai is a native of Fujian. - Chen Miner, 57, was seen to have performed strongly as party boss of the southwestern province of Guizhou, before replacing Sun Zhengcai, the corruption-tainted party secretary of the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing, in July. Chen, a native of Zhejiang, is virtually assured at least a seat in the Politburo given his position in Chongqing. Chen was editor-in-chief of the official Zhejiang Daily from 1999 to 2001 and propaganda minister under Xi in Zhejiang in 2001. - Han Zheng, 63, is party chief of Shanghai, China's financial hub, where he has spent his entire career. Han was briefly promoted from Shanghai mayor after the then-party boss was sacked amid a corruption scandal in 2006. He resumed his mayoral role as Xi Jinping and then Yu Zhengsheng - currently the party's fourth-ranked leader - became party chief. Han became Shanghai party boss in 2012. - Hu Chunhua, 54, is the Guangdong province party chief and currently the Politburo's youngest member. Hu spent two decades in Tibet, where he came under the wing of former President Hu Jintao, and speaks Tibetan. The two are not related. Before coming to Guangdong, he ran the vast northern region of Inner Mongolia, where he successfully defused anti-mining protests by ethnic Mongols. Hu grew up in poverty in the mountains of Hubei province in central China. - Li Shulei, 53, was admitted to the prestigious Peking University, majoring in library science, at the age of 14. He obtained a master's degree in modern Chinese literature and pursued a doctorate at the same school. He spent 24 years at the Central Party School, which trains cadres, serving as vice president for four years until 2014. He overlapped with Xi when the latter was president of the school, serving as his speech writer. After a two-year stint as Fujian provincial propaganda chief, Li was the top graft buster in Beijing for a year before becoming deputy to Wang Qishan in January. Li is a native of the central province of Henan. - Li Zhanshu, 67, heads the party's General Office. He worked his way up from Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, and graduated from Hebei Normal University. A former governor of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and one-time party boss of the southwestern province of Guizhou, Li is considered one of Xi's closest advisors and often accompanies him on overseas trips. Their friendship dates back to their days working together in Hebei in the 1980s. - Liu Qibao, 64, is China's propaganda minister and was formerly party boss of the southwestern province of Sichuan. According to an official biography, he comes from a poor background and rose to the upper echelons of the party through the Communist Youth League. Unusually for a senior Chinese official, he engaged with the public online when he was in Sichuan. But he took a hard-line approach to tackling self-immolations and protests in ethnic Tibetan parts of Sichuan. - Wang Huning, who turns 62 this month, was a top policy researcher for the party under former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, a position he has kept under Xi as head of the Central Policy Research Office. Wang coined the ""Three Represents"" and ""Scientific Outlook of Development"" - respectively Jiang and Hu's contributions to party thought, as well as the ""Chinese Dream"", Xi's own vision. Wang was formerly an academic at Shanghai's Fudan University, specialising first in international relations and then law. He is also considered one of Xi's closest advisors. - Wang Yang, 62, is a vice premier with an economic portfolio and a former party chief of Guangdong province, an export powerhouse, where he served from 2007-2012. Born into a poor rural family in eastern Anhui province, Wang went to work in a factory at age 17 to support his family after his father died. Concerned about the impact of three decades of rapid development, he lobbied for social and political reform. However, he backed down after drawing criticism from party conservatives. - Zhao Leji, 60, was named vice governor of the northwestern province of Qinghai in 1994 at age 37. Zhao spent 29 years in Qinghai before being picked by Xi to serve as party boss of Shaanxi province, in the northwest, in 2007. Both Zhao and Xi are natives of Shaanxi. Zhao heads the powerful organisation department, which oversees personnel decisions, and is a Politburo member. He has a degree in philosophy from Peking University.

The two new residents, Meng Meng and Jiao Qing, will fly into Berlin on a special Lufthansa cargo plane on June 24, accompanied by two Chinese vets, Berlin zoo's chief vet, and a tonne of bamboo. The pandas will be served ""bamboo snacks"" and water, and their transport box kept dry and odourless with absorbent mats during the 12 hour and 20 minute-long flight. Meng Meng means ""dream"" in Chinese while the zoo says Jiao Qing translates to ""darling"", although the Chinese characters are a composite of ""tender"" and ""festive"". Ahead of their arrival, Berlin zoo, the bears' new home, has built a 1,000 metre square (10,700 square feet) enclosure, which includes a wooded climbing area. The zoo will also pay a million dollars a year (920,000 euros) for the 15-year contract to host the pair, with most of the funds going towards a breeding research programme in China and the protection of pandas in their natural habitat. Chancellor Angela Merkel previously announced that Germany was in talks with Beijing to bring a pair of the rare bears to Berlin during a visit to China in 2015          What's so special about pandas?  Famed for its ""panda diplomacy"", China has sent its unofficial national mascot to only around a dozen countries, to signal their healthy ties with Beijing. After a period of acclimatisation in their new Berlin home, Meng Meng and Jiao Qing are expected to presented to the public. As Chinese President Xi Jinping is due to travel to Germany to attend the G20 summit on July 7 and 8, German media has speculated that he and Merkel may jointly unveil the cuddly bears on July 5. China has previously gifted three pandas to Germany, but the last one, 34-year-old Bao Bao, died in Berlin in 2012 -- he had been the oldest male panda in the world. Fewer than 2,000 giant pandas are estimated to remain in the wild, in three provinces in south-central China."

The former US secretary of state spoke to packed audiences in Sydney and Melbourne last week, sharing the stage with former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard. Mrs Clinton has hosed down calls for Mr Trump to be given a Nobel Peace prize if the June 12 meeting in Singapore is successful in ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. ""We've been down this road with the North before, where they've made promises and then within a year or more it's determined that they have broken those promises,"" she told ABC 7.30 in an interview that will air on Monday night. ""Look, if there is a positive outcome that can be verified... not a one-off announcement at a summit, I will join in the applause."" She says China and South Korean diplomatic efforts had been a game changer. ""I think the change in leadership in South Korea is significant,"" she said. ""The new president (Moon Jae-in) came in with a very public view that he wanted to see if there could be a rapprochement -- the dream of the South has always been reunification."" The Chinese had also been active, she said, pointing to the two meetings between Mr Kim and Chinese President Xi Jinping in the lead-up to the Singapore talks. In the wake of claims of Russian meddling in the US election and the debate in Australia about Chinese influence, Mrs Clinton reiterated warnings about taking the threat of foreign interference seriously. ""I don't care what side of the political aisle you might be on, in either Australia or the United States.

Recon has assets of more than 100 billion yuan ($15 billion), according to its website.        A Chinese group owned by Tony Jiantong Xia bought Aston Villa in a deal worth a reported $86 million ©Glyn Kirk (AFP/File) Wealthy Chinese entrepreneurs have poured money into football, with President Xi Jinping hoping that the Asian giant will one day host and win the World Cup.Recon says it has played host to Xi and other top officials. A picture on the company website is captioned as showing Xi, then the Communist Party chief of the eastern province of Zhejiang, visiting the company in 2005.Another image is labelled as Chinese Premier Li Keqiang touring a subsidiary, and a third is said to show another top Chinese Communist, Zhang Dejiang, visiting the company and praising its ""digital cities"" efforts.Xia is not identified in any of the pictures, despite being the company chairman, chief executive and owner.Searches by AFP did not find Chinese news reports of any of the three visits.Announcing the sale, Aston Villa said that Recon ""owns the controlling interest in five publicly listed companies on the Hong Kong and Chinese stock exchanges"".The Recon website says the same, but only names one of the subsidiaries, Lotus Health Group.It claims to be the world's second largest producer of food additive monosodium glutamate but lost $78 million last year, according to a statement to the Shanghai stock exchange, where it is listed.""Life is a marathon and building a company is an endurance race as well,"" Xia said in a posting on his microblog last year.- 'Stage a comeback!' -Xia's love of football is said to stem from playing striker as a student, with one online post identifying his alma mater as Beijing Forestry University, where he studied landscape architecture.He later studied at Harvard, MIT and Oxford University, according to a biography published by Aston Villa. He is a published author, with a book on urban planning selling on the Chinese website of Amazon, whose single customer reviewer gives it five stars.But doubts have been raised about Xia's credentials.Fang Zhouzi, a prominent Chinese sceptic who operates a platform dedicated to exposing academic fraud such as plagiarism, questioned multiple Chinese reports that quoted Xia as claiming to be the youngest ever professor at Harvard.In response, Xia said the media had exaggerated and he was only a professor's assistant.There is also confusion over his age. His verified Weibo microblog gives a birthday that would make him 39, but a listed unit's annual report issued in April gave his age as 41.Xia is the latest Chinese tycoon to heed Xi's call to develop football in the world's most populous country.The Wanda Group of Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin -- who openly acknowledges that his footballing investments have political motivations -- bought a 20 percent stake in Spain's Atletico Madrid last year, and in March it signed a sponsorship deal with FIFA, football's troubled world body.State-linked China Media Capital led a consortium to buy a stake of just over a 13 percent in Premier League club Manchester City for $400 million in December. Xi himself included the club on a state visit to Britain before the deal, and posed for a memorable selfie with player Sergio Aguero.Aston Villa crashed out of the Premier League in April after a miserable season that saw the team win just three of 38 matches. Xia's dream is to return the club to the top flight and have them finish in the first six, according to a statement.In an online posting discussing losing out on a business deal to a competitor, he said: ""Do not lose courage after defeat, stage a comeback!""

79,China sci-fi blockbuster blasts off at the box office,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6719543/China-sci-fi-blockbuster-blasts-box-office.html," 04:55 BST, 19 February 2019 ","          The movie draws on pride in China's growing space programme and is packed with advanced special effects  China's first space-age blockbuster is on a trajectory to become the country's highest-grossing movie ever and is being held up as evidence that big-budget home-grown films can now hold their own with Hollywood on pure spectacle. ""The Wandering Earth"" has made more than 3.9 billion yuan ($576 million) in domestic box office as of Tuesday morning, putting it on course to eclipse the 5.7 billion yuan earned in 2017 by current champion, ""Wolf Warrior 2"". Based on a novel by Chinese science fiction writer Liu Cixin, the film tells the story -- through the eyes of Chinese protagonists -- of a project to move the earth away from a dying sun using giant fusion-powered engines. Reportedly made with a $50 million budget, the movie draws on pride in China's growing space programme and is packed with advanced special effects. Director Guo Fan said that three-quarters of the more than 2,000 special-effects shots were created by Chinese staff. Noted film commentator Wang Hailin told a recent movie seminar that ""The Wandering Earth"" showed that ""the historic moment to rival Hollywood has arrived."" ""The Wandering Earth"" has also made $3.8 million in North America in the 11 days since its release, the highest for a Chinese film in nearly five years, the film's official social media account said on Sunday. With Chinese President Xi Jinping asserting tight control over arts and entertainment and pushing patriotic themes, any Chinese film depicting a future world is bound to draw political scrutiny. But the movie largely ignores politics, with no mention of China's ruling Communist Party. Chinese heroes figure most prominently in the action, but the film's overall message is to encourage international collaboration. In a pivotal scene, a Chinese astronaut played by martial artist and actor Wu Jing -- the star of the ""Wolf Warrior"" franchise -- works closely with a Russian counterpart in a bid to save the world. Co-produced by state-owned China Film Group Co. and Beijing Jingxi Culture and Tourism Co., ""Wandering Earth"" also shows frames -- rare for a Chinese movie -- of a destroyed Beijing and collapsing landmarks in Shanghai as apocalypse hits. Liu, the Hugo Award-winning author of the story, said in an interview with state television that China lacks good original science fiction, but that the strong ""sense of future"" in the rapidly modernising country bodes well for the genre. Director Guo conceded that Chinese sci-fi films still have a long way to go to keep pace with Hollywood's high standards, but he was hopeful. ""Science fiction is the barometer of a nation.... If this nation wants to embrace the world and dream of the future, then the journey of Chinese sci-fi will be an ocean of stars and (have) a broad future,"" he told state television."

George Osborne is expected to use a state visit to the UK by Chinese Premier Xi Jinping next week to finalise a dealBut last night it emerged that ministers have drawn up contingency plans to seize control of the plants if relations with the Communist state become strained.A Whitehall source told the BBC that Chinese-run reactors could be nationalised ‘as a last resort’.

Former British intelligence officer Nigel Inkster said the risks of Chinese involvement were hard to assess without seeing details of the contract setting out how the new plants would be run         Downing Street yesterday insisted that Chinese involvement in the nuclear industry was good for Britain‘Until we see the nuclear deal, we cannot be specific about the risks or how they might be mitigated.’Downing Street yesterday insisted that Chinese involvement in the nuclear industry was good for Britain.A No 10 spokesman said: ‘We are in a new era of engagement with China, we are working closely with them on a number of issues.‘But we take security extremely seriously and will continue to keep it under review.’He went on: ‘We would not be pursuing this course of action if we felt there was a risk to security.’Energy Secretary Amber Rudd also played down security concerns surrounding the Chinese deal. She told the Daily Mail: ‘We have the strongest level of nuclear regulation in the world, and the best record of nuclear safety. That is the system that any country from around the world will have to engage with if it wants to operate here.’But security experts are worried less by the ability of the Chinese to operate nuclear facilities safely than by the potential risk of sabotage.Despite a thawing in relations, Britain’s intelligence agencies continue to regard China as a significant threat, particularly in terms of cyber-espionage.MI5 has warned publicly that the ‘intelligence services of China… continue to work against UK interests at home and abroad’.A security source said: ‘There is a big division between the money men and the security side. The Treasury is in the lead, and it isn’t listening to anyone – they see China as an opportunity, but we see the threat.’But the Treasury is keen to secure Chinese funding for a £25 billion nuclear reactor at Hinkley Point, in Somerset, and a second power station at Sizewell, in Suffolk.During a trip to China last month, George Osborne offered loan guarantees worth £2 billion to help secure Chinese backing for Hinkley Point.Speaking in Beijing, the Chancellor described the proposed deal as ‘a win-win-win for the UK and … a great example of how the relationship with China has a direct material benefit to the people living in our country’.He added: ‘I think we have to confront any anxieties that exist out there about Chinese investment in British civil nuclear power.’Paul Dorfman, of University College London’s Energy Institute, said: ‘No one else in Europe would cut this deal. America wouldn’t dream of letting China have such a part in its critical national infrastructure. The idea the UK is prepared to do it is frankly astounding.’ "

When Bekali, a Kazakh Muslim, refused, he was forced to stand at a wall for five hours at a time. A week later, he was sent to solitary confinement and deprived of food for 24 hours. After 20 days, he wanted to kill himself. ""The psychological pressure is enormous, when you have to criticize yourself, denounce your thinking - your own ethnic group,"" said Bekali, 42, who broke down in tears while describing the camp.

The program aims to rewire detainees' thinking and reshape their identities. Chinese officials say ideological changes are needed to fight Islamic extremism. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)  Since last spring, Chinese authorities in the heavily Muslim region of Xinjiang have ensnared tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of Muslim Chinese - and even foreign citizens - in mass internment camps. This detention campaign has swept across Xinjiang, a territory half the area of India, leading to what a U.S. commission on China last month said is ""the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today."" The internment program tries to rewire the political thinking of detainees, erase their Islamic beliefs and reshape their very identities. Chinese officials have largely avoided comment, but some have said in state media that ideological changes are needed to fight separatism and Islamic extremism. Radical Muslim Uighurs killed hundreds in China in years past. Three other former internees and a former instructor in different centers corroborated Bekali's depiction. Taken together, the recollections offer the most detailed account yet of life inside so-called re-education. The program is a hallmark of China's emboldened state security apparatus under the deeply nationalistic, hard-line rule of President Xi Jinping. It is partly rooted in the ancient Chinese belief in transformation through education - taken once before to terrifying extremes during the mass thought reform campaigns of Mao Zedong, the Chinese leader sometimes channeled by Xi. ""Cultural cleansing is Beijing's attempt to find a final solution to the Xinjiang problem,"" said James Millward, a China historian at Georgetown University. The internment system is shrouded in secrecy, with no publicly available data. The U.S. State Department estimates those being held are ""at the very least in the tens of thousands."" A Turkey-based TV station run by Xinjiang exiles said almost 900,000 were detained, citing leaked government documents. Adrian Zenz, a researcher at the European School of Culture and Theology, puts the number between several hundreds of thousands and just over 1 million, and government bids suggest construction is ongoing. Asked to comment on the camps, China's foreign ministry said it ""had not heard"" of the situation. Chinese officials in Xinjiang did not respond to requests for comment. However, China's top prosecutor, Zhang Jun, urged Xinjiang's authorities this month to extensively expand what the government calls ""transformation through education"" in an ""all-out effort"" to fight extremism. China-born Bekali moved to Kazakhstan in 2006 and received citizenship three years later. On March 25 last year, Bekali visited his parents in Xinjiang. The next day, police took him away. They strapped him into a ""tiger chair"" that clamped down his wrists and ankles. They hung him by his wrists against a barred wall. They interrogated him about his work inviting Chinese to apply for Kazakh tourist visas. ""I haven't committed any crimes!"" Bekali yelled. Seven months later, Bekali was taken out of his cell and handed a release paper. But he was not free. Bekali was driven to a fenced compound in Karamay, where three buildings held more than 1,000 internees. They would wake up together before dawn, sing the Chinese national anthem, and raise the Chinese flag at 7:30 am. They sang songs praising the party and studied Chinese language and history. They were told that the indigenous sheep-herding Central Asian people of Xinjiang were backward before they were ""liberated"" by the Communist Party in the 1950s. When they ate meals of vegetable soup and buns, they first had to chant: ""Thank the Party! Thank the Motherland! Thank President Xi!"" Bekali was kept in a locked room almost around the clock with eight other internees, who shared beds and a wretched toilet. Cameras were installed in toilets and outhouses. Baths were rare, as was washing of hands and feet, equated with Islamic ablution. In 4-hour sessions, instructors lectured about the dangers of Islam and drilled internees with quizzes that they had to answer correctly or be sent to stand near a wall for hours on end. ""Do you obey Chinese law or Sharia?"" instructors asked. ""Do you understand why religion is dangerous?"" The detainees had to criticize and be criticized by their peers. One by one, they would also stand up before 60 classmates to present self-criticisms of their religious history. ""I was taught the Holy Quran by my father and I learned it because I didn't know better,"" Bekali heard one say. ""I traveled outside China without knowing that I could be exposed to extremist thoughts abroad,"" another said. ""Now I know."" After a week, Bekali went to his first stint in solitary confinement. He yelled out to a visiting official. ""Take me in the back and kill me, or send me back to prison,"" he shouted. ""I can't be here anymore."" He was again hauled off to solitary confinement. It lasted 24 hours, ending late afternoon on Nov. 24, when Bekali was suddenly released. At first, Bekali did not want the AP to publish his account for fear his sister and mother in China would be detained. But on March 10, the police took his sister, Adila Bekali. A week later, they took his mother, Amina Sadik. And on April 24, his father, Ebrayem. Bekali changed his mind and said he wanted to tell his story. ""Things have already come this far,"" he said.

Boys attend a training session at a football club in Beijing ©Greg Baker (AFP) The Asian giant has made improving youth football programmes a national priority, with an official plan promising 20,000 academies and 30 million elementary and middle school pupils playing the sport within four years.The goal is to make China one of the world's top sides by 2050, the document said, to bring to life ""the sports-superpower dream"".But it faces steep social barriers, with trainers saying traditional attitudes towards education and children's responsibility to support their parents in retirement make it difficult to secure recruits.""The big challenge is that mindset in general, that football is a distraction to education,"" said Tom Byer, a Japan-based football consultant hired by the Chinese education ministry to design pilot programmes for young children.""If you look at families that have just one child it's kind of a no-brainer. If you're thinking about the future of your child, should you put an emphasis on sports... or should you nurture your child to be better academically?""To assuage concerns, Byer tells Chinese parents that studies suggest kids who are physically active do better academically.But parents online ask whether it is ""irresponsible"" for children to play soccer.- 'Just a hobby' -At a practice session for a children's football club in Beijing, parents praised the sport for giving seven-year-olds the experience of overcoming challenges and defeat, but said they were wary of letting it interfere with studies.Song Feng, 41, said soccer was ""just a hobby, an exercise"" for her 11-year-old son, and that studies would always have to come first ""because China's education system is just that way now"".Gao Fei, father of another boy, said he ""won't let him become a footballer because China's professional soccer scene is no good"".Chinese media have weighed in to try to reassure them.An article on internet portal Sohu cited French philosopher Albert Camus and Danish physicist Niels Bohr, who both played in goal for club sides, as proof that sporting and academic pursuits were compatible.""Playing soccer means falling behind in studies? Teachers and parents wake up, don't waste your child's future!"" it said.While Beijing's plans should see more football played in school, China's education system still revolves around the highly competitive, all-important gaokao graduation exam, which determines university placement and many career opportunities.That makes it difficult to stimulate a mass craze for football, as the structure ""leaves very little space or time for sports"", said Mary Gallagher, associate professor of political science at the University of Michigan. ""Will parents risk points on the gaokao for the chance to play soccer every day?""The world's most populous nation has 25 times more people than England, but lags far behind its 37,000 football clubs, says Rowan Simons, a football author and founder of a private football club in the capital.- Long game -Without grassroots teams and a deep pool of players, he said, ""It's irrelevant how much money the government puts into it -- football can never flourish unless people love it.""""In Chinese there's just no history of civic society, that's really at the heart of it,"" Simons told AFP. ""That's why top-down national funding will never work.""One challenge to developing players is China's traditional training methods, says Mark Dreyer of China Sports Insider, in which the coach ""is still the military drill sergeant where he's barking orders and having them do repetitive drills. What kid enjoys that?""In other countries, he said, ""they play football with a smile on their face"".Chinese Super League clubs are splashing vast sums on foreign coaches and players, many of them from Latin America, where Byer says children learn basic ball-handling skills at a very early age.Countries that want to emulate the success of Brazil and others have to ensure that football is an activity at home as well as at school, he added.""It will take a couple of decades,"" he said. ""When you're dealing with youth development, we won't know if we're going to reap the benefits for 10 years.""The question is whether the Chinese government's footballing push can last that long. While President Xi is a soccer fan, he is expected to step down in 2022 and his successor may have entirely different priorities.""Can they stay the course? It's possible,"" said Dreyer. ""But in five, 10 years, who knows? If Xi Jinping goes, and the next guy doesn't like football, then maybe it's basketball and Yao Ming is going to lead the way.""

""But at the same time, as a developed country we want to cut emissions to reduce the problem of PM 2.5,"" he added, referring to tiny particulates which have become an emblem of the country's pollution crisis.""China has to take up certain responsibilities,"" he said. ""It increasingly finds it difficult to take a free ride,"" stressing that if the US ignored its global responsibilities, the international system would ""collapse"".- Successive summits -Chinese state media have lauded Xi, but the Communist leader's interactions with other heads of state, at a series of summits in recent weeks, tell a more nuanced story of the challenges China faces.Under Xi, Beijing has been increasingly assertive in pursuing territorial claims against Tokyo in the East China Sea and other neighbours in the South China Sea.Xi's awkward meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit last week followed a narrowly-crafted agreement which both sides could spin as a victory on their own terms, and was marked by barely concealed mutual distaste, evident from images of the two leaders shaking hands.Despite the dramatic emissions targets announced with US President Barack Obama in Beijing, the two sides made clear they hold fundamentally opposite positions on multiple issues including human rights and regional security.Both Abe and Obama were in Beijing this month to participate in the APEC forum leaders' meeting, the first of three successive regional and global summits that culminated with the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia -- which China will host in 2016.China's role at the centre of proceedings contrasted noticeably with that of fellow UN Security Council permanent member Russia, whose president left the G20 early as Western countries criticised him over Ukraine and other issues.- Compete and cooperate -But China's potential as a diplomatic middleman is constrained by history and its domestic priorities.Kim Han-Kwon, an expert at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said that China's Communist leaders have embraced ""patriotic nationalism"" since the end of the Cold War to replace socialist ideology as a unifying internal glue.As a result they are pushed ""to show a more strong and stern image of China to protect China's own national interest"", he said.Before Xi and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced a deal to slash trade barriers, Obama warned of the dangers of outright conflict in Asia as China contests disputed territory.The US, Japanese and Australian leaders committed their countries to deepening existing strong security cooperation in the Asia-Pacific -- with China the obvious object of their attentions.Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese politics at the University of Sydney, said that Xi does not want ""challenges from the external world"" to distract China from internal changes such as transforming the economy towards more stable and sustainable growth.""The question now is will the rest of the world let it do this without making more demands on it,"" he said.That may be unavoidable. At the global level the US and China both compete and cooperate on issues such as climate change and the denuclearisation of North Korea, said Kim of the Asan Institute.But he added that in the realm of ""regional international politics in Northeast Asia, strategic competition between the US and China has increased"".

The nation's first such vessel, the Liaoning, is a secondhand Soviet ship built more than 25 years ago that was commissioned by China in 2012 after extensive refits.- 'Influential and persuasive' -The Global Times newspaper, known for its nationalistic editorial stance, said new conditions required a strong army and cited the United States as a reason.""If China has a big gap with the US in terms of military prowess, this will affect its international position and other countries' attitude toward China,"" it said in an editorial posted on its website Saturday.""With a strong army, China can be more politically appealing, influential and persuasive.""Beijing's forces have been involved in sometimes tense confrontations with Japanese and Philippine units over maritime disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea respectively, prompting fears that the disputes could result in armed clashes.The new PLA Rocket Force, meanwhile, is tasked with maintaining conventional and nuclear weaponry with the ability to both deter and strike, Xi told a ceremony for the founding of the three new organisations, according to Xinhua.But a spokesman for China's Ministry of Defence denied any shift in the country's nuclear weapons policy.""China's nuclear policy and nuclear strategy are consistent, there has been no change whatsoever,"" spokesman Yang Yujun said Friday, according to a transcript posted on the ministry's website.The new unit would take over from the Second Artillery Force, he said.At a military parade in September, China showed off ""carrier-killer"" missiles, including the land-based DF-21D intermediate-range type which is thought to be equipped with onboard terminal guidance systems that give it the unprecedented ability to attack a moving target.A Chinese analyst said the latest moves were aimed at modernising the military.""For a long time, China had no overseas interests, the navy, air force and guided missile units were relatively weak compared with the army,"" Ni Lexiong, a professor at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, told AFP.""To catch up with European and American powers...

The U.S. firm hopes it will offset an otherwise lacklustre international theme park business, better known for cash-burning sites such as Euro Disney.""This is one of the proudest and most exciting moments in the history of the Walt Disney Company,"" chief executive Bob Iger said at the official ribbon cutting ceremony on Thursday, where he was flanked by Chinese government officials.Iger and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang read out letters of support from Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping.Not everything has gone quite to plan though.The opening gala - meant to be a bonanza of fireworks, live music and dance - was rained off on Wednesday night, while at Disney's park in Orlando, Florida, a young boy was grabbed by an alligator and killed.Disney, though, sees China as its biggest opportunity since Walt Disney bought land in Florida in the 1960s for what is now Walt Disney World - the world's most-visited theme park.With that in mind, Main Street has been replaced by Mickey Avenue to reduce the feel of Americana while attractions include the Chinese-style Wandering Moon tea house, a Chinese Zodiac-themed garden and a Tarzan musical featuring Chinese acrobats.Disney estimates 330 million people within a three-hour radius of Shanghai will be able to afford to come to the park: that includes Zhao Qiong, 36, who was one of the first visitors inside the park on Thursday with her 4-year-old daughter.""Since she was young, my little girl has always loved Disney princesses, so I wanted to bring her to the park to fulfil her dream,"" she told Reuters.ALREADY EXPANDINGThe iconic U.S. firm is already expanding the Shanghai site to keep the home crowd keen, in a country where competition from a plethora of local theme parks promises to be fierce.""There is actually construction going on this week. When we open we will continue the construction to expand what's on the opening day menu,"" said Iger, who first scoped out the seven square kilometre plot in 1999.""We have plenty of space to do that and we believe we've got willing partners ... We think we will probably do that sooner rather than later.""Shanghai Disney could also help lure more consumers to its hit films such as ""Zootopia"" and ""Captain America: Civil War"", which are among the top grossing films in China this year.Disney, though, is facing intense competition from homegrown parks and domestic cartoon characters. Consumers also have an ambivalent attitude to its products, with some being sceptical about American values overriding Chinese traditions and culture.Iger received a presidential welcome from Xi Jinping in May, and Disney has been granted ""special"" trademark protection. But China's main military newspaper has also warned that ""Zootopia"", a story about a rabbit police officer in an animal city, was a tool for spreading U.S. propaganda and ideals.Furthermore, Disney will have to share the spoils with its joint venture partner state-owned Shendi Group, which has a 57 percent stake - a concession agreed during lengthy negotiations.Shendi is a consortium controlled by four large government-owned companies: Shanghai Media Group; hotelier Jin Jiang International, controlled by the city of Shanghai; supermarket-to-department store operator Bailian Group, and property developer Lujiazui Development Group.(Additional reporting by Jiang Xihao, Anita Li and SHANGHAI newsroom; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Jacqueline Wong)"
86,How China could benefit from Pakistan's 'dream corridor',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-4347108/How-China-benefit-Pakistan-s-dream-corridor.html," 23:11 BST, 24 March 2017 ","For Pakistan it was a dream come true. When Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad in April 2015, he pledged a whopping Rs 3,00,894 crore for the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). While the mega project was a vital element of the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) for Beijing, it was a 'game-changer' for Pakistan, as it would bring prosperity to the entire region. It's true that Xi brought with him munificent gifts for Pakistan: the Chinese billions would boost Pakistan's flagging economy with massive energy and infrastructure projects.          Chinese President Xi Jinping speaking in Islamabad in 2015, when he said both Pakistan and China share common threats and should stick together to confront themThis included an additional 12,000 megawatts to Pakistan's national grid through coal, hydro and renewable energy projects. The Corridor would have railways, roads, optical fibre cables, dams, pipelines, you name it! Though observers marveled Beijing's generosity (and wealth), but lately, the 'beneficiaries' have started realising that the project may first and foremost benefit Beijing! Security The architects of CPEC plan to build a 2,700-km corridor stretching from Kashgar to Gwadar, which will link Central Asia (via Xinjiang) to Europe and Africa (via the maritime route). Is it a boon for Islamabad? Not everyone agrees, even in Pakistan. Salman Rafi Sheikh, a research analyst wrote in Asia Times: 'The CPEC continues to look like a mystery.          Security forces at Gwadar Port in Pakistan. Gwadar is the cornerstone of Chinese President Xi Jinping's so-called One Belt, One Road project to rebuild the ancient Silk Road - a trading route connecting China to the Arabian Sea which slices through the Himalayas and crosses deserts and disputed territory to reach this ancient fishing port.In the absence of agreements stipulating and documenting both countries' interests, the CPEC is creating problems that would strip Pakistan of benefits the multi-billion-dollar project promises. Claims about CPEC's ability to change Pakistan's economic outlook appear hollow and unreal. The question is — what's the game changer for the region when CPEC is changing nothing in Pakistan?' The author certainly has a point. It's true that the Corridor faces several serious issues, security for example. Now, suppose the scheme becomes 'unstable' due to terrorism (presently localised in Pakistan, but which can be easily exported to Xinjiang), the cost of the project could tremendously shoot up.          A truck reverses while delivering rocks to a development site at Marine Drive in Gwadar, Balochistan, Pakistan. Gwadar is the cornerstone of Chinese President Xi Jinping's so-called One Belt, One Road projectThis deeply worries Beijing. Last month, The Dawn reported that Pakistan has deployed 15,000 military personnel, 'as part of the Special Security Division (SSD) and Maritime Security Force (MSF) to protect projects under the CPEC'. Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on CPEC, noted: 'Both forces will work under the interior ministry, in coordination with the provinces.' The question is, who is going to pay the bill? Quoting military sources, The South China Morning Post affirms that the PLA would soon increase its fighting force to 100,000 personnel, 'allowing for deployment in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa and Gwadar in southwest Pakistan.' Chinese troops in Gwadar, the main entry to the CPEC, is worrisome, to say the least.          Chinese workers pose for a picture with Pakistani soldiers at a ceremony to open a pilot trade project in Gwadar portRecently Pakistan's Public Accounts Committee asked for the details of rate of interest for the loans obtained from China. The secretary of the Ministry of Water and Power gave some figures: there were 19 power projects under the CPEC with the capacity of 12,114 MW; out of which 3,960 MW from coal, 2,714 MW from hydro projects, 900 MW from solar projects and 4,260 MW from imported coal. Economy The amazing part is that after the COP21 accords, the planet is abandoning coal, but China is financing new coal projects in Pakistan with Chinese coal! Beijing has agreed to provide a Rs 39,250 crore loan for road infrastructure and Rs 2.8 billion for Railways 'on the lowest interest rate'. While these loans are at a reasonable 1.6 per cent interest, in some other cases, the interest can be as high as six or seven per cent. Will Pakistan be able to repay these loans? By including the cost of insurance, also paid to a Chinese insurance company, the cost of borrowings could surge to 13 per cent. 'Adding insult to injury, the government has already exempted income of Chinese financial institutions from dividend income tax,' said The Pakistan Herald.          Security forces ride on the backs of trucks en route to Gwadar, Balochistan, PakistanAnother issue is regional disparity. On February 28, Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal, president of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), accused Islamabad of getting funds for the project in the name of Gwadar while using them in one province only, Punjab. Mengal argued that the people of Balochistan, a province through which a major portion of the Corridor passes, have neither been consulted nor taken into confidence on CPEC projects. Other provinces, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (for the western route of CPEC) and Gilgit-Baltistan have similar views. Legality As the project crosses Indian territory in PoK, the CPEC is unacceptable for India. Delhi cannot pretend that nothing is happening and forget about the legality of the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India. Beijing has hinted that India should join the 'global' project, but China doesn't seem to be ready to implement what it is preaching. After Tibet was invaded by China in October 1950, the traditional Himalayan trade routes were closed down.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       How the Modi government should play the Tibet card in...    JeM chief block shows China's determination to shield...      Share this article Share   An effort was made in 1954 to regulate the flow of people and goods through the 'Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet region of China and India' — the Panchsheel Agreement — but, China wasn't ready to implement the letter or the spirit of the Agreement which lapsed in 1962. While China is adamant to not reopen the Himalayan land ports between India and Tibet, why 'invite' Delhi to join the CPEC bandwagon? There is no logic. In any case, the Corridor is first and foremost a vital investment for Beijing, which is slowly 'buying' the strategic corridor; Beijing will soon control its new dominion, Pakistan. For India, it will be a game changer as it will then face China on two fronts, the northern and the western ones. Modi should ponder about this."

At least three ""auditors"" will have to check all movies, dramas, documentaries and animations posted online to ensure they adhere to ""core socialist values"", the industry body the China Netcasting Services Association (CNSA) said. The rules, which build upon guidelines released in 2012, come as authorities are cracking down on online content such as literature, livestreaming, news and social media - a broad campaign aimed at controlling social discourse online. Weibo Corp, the operator of China's top microblogging site, said this week it would block unapproved video content and work more closely with state media to promote ""mainstream"" ideas, following a sharp rebuke from regulators. Authorities also ordered internet companies this month to close 60 celebrity gossip social media accounts to help ""actively propagate core socialist values"" and prop up ""mainstream public opinion"". Under the new guidance, which comes into immediate effect, censors should check that content adheres to proper Chinese values and strive to tell Chinese stories to help ""realise the China dream of a great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" Content should ""sing the motherland, eulogize heroes, celebrate our times in song, and lead the people to hold the correct historical, ethnic, national and cultural view"". Programmes that undermined a respectful national image, ridiculed leaders, promoted negative or decadent views of life and showed the ""dark side"" of society would be edited, or in severe cases stopped. President Xi Jinping has overseen measures to clamp down on independent online media, while reasserting the ruling Communist Party's role in limiting and guiding online discussion. The Cyberspace Administration of China in May released regulations for online news portals and network providers, which extended restrictions on content and required all services to be managed by party-sanctioned editorial staff. The new rules also laid out a range of issues that did not meet with approval, including violence, drug addiction, extramarital affairs and religious cults. Also on the list was homosexuality, underlining the conservative official view on same-sex relations. (Reporting by Adam Jourdan and SHANGHAI newsroom; Editing by Robert Birsel)"

Plans call for again qualifying for the sport's marquee event, hosting it and winning the title by 2050.To that end, China last year signed Brazil's World Cup-winning manager Marcello Lippi to take over the national men's team. The government has also ordered the creation of 70,000 football fields to fill gaps in its youth program.Teams in China's professional leagues, meanwhile, have recruited international stars such as Alex Teixeira and Jackson Martinez on highly paid contracts, raising concerns that they are neglecting home-grown talent.In response, China's football association last month said it plans a series of measures in response to ""irrational"" spending by clubs. It also reduced the number of foreigners who can play per club at any given time from four to three and required that each team's starting list must include at least two Chinese players under age 23."
90,Premier: China will offer Taiwan 'preferential policies',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6812221/Premier-China-offer-Taiwan-preferential-policies.html," 04:29 BST, 15 March 2019 "," BEIJING (AP) - China will introduce more ""preferential policies"" for Taiwan so the self-governed island's residents can enjoy the same treatment as mainland Chinese citizens, Premier Li Keqiang said Friday. Li said new initiatives will be implemented to invite people from Taiwan to ""work hand-in-hand to realize our shared dream for the nation."" They follow 31 incentives recently introduced to bolster China's argument that political unification should follow increasingly close economic ties. Such appeals form the carrot in China's strategy toward Taiwan in contrast with the stick of threatened military attack. China has used increasingly aggressive rhetoric toward Taiwan, which split from the mainland amid a civil war 70 years ago, but has sought to balance the two approaches to try to avoid alienating those in the island republic who are wary of Beijing. The ruling Communist Party maintains that Taiwan is part of China. It opposes Taiwan independence and formally says it seeks a ""peaceful reunification."" President Xi Jinping did not rule out the use of force during a January speech on cross-strait relations, when he proposed a ""one country, two systems"" approach akin to China's current arrangement with the former British colony of Hong Kong. That would enable Taiwan to keep its own economic and legal system.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)  The suggestion has been rejected by Taiwan's independence-leaning President Tsai Ing-wen, who said China must accept the continued existence of the Republic of China, the formal name of the former mainland government that fled to Taiwan in 1949. The U.S. switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, but remains a key Taiwanese bulwark against China's threats. China appears pleased with the impact of last year's ""31 Measures,"" and Li held open the possibility of even greater advantages, while offering no details. ""When people on both sides of the strait enjoy the same development opportunities, they will become closer and closer,"" Li said at a news conference held on the closing day of the ceremonial legislature's annual session.

Mao Zedong, the son of a wealthy farmer, dreamed of transforming China into a communist paradise and stopped at nothing to achieve his vision Yet his legacy remains problematic for China, the Communist Party, and its current chairman Xi Jinping, according to Frank Dikotter, a Mao expert at Hong Kong University, describing him as ""both the Lenin and the Stalin"" of the ruling party.""He's both the one who like Lenin brought the Communist Party to power and he's the one who like Stalin committed horrendous crimes against humanity,"" he said.The son of a wealthy farmer, Mao dreamed of transforming the nation into a communist paradise and stopped at nothing to achieve his vision.He was among the Chinese Communist Party's founders in 1921, and fought for 28 years against his own countrymen and the Japanese.Finally on October 1, 1949 he declared the People's Republic in Tiananmen Square, but his dream quickly turned into a nightmare.He ordered multiple purges to fight ""counter-revolutionary"" influence in the party, which are believed to have killed hundreds of thousands of people.Tens of millions starved to death in the late 1950s during his Great Leap Forward, an ill-conceived attempt to force the country into communes.And in the decade leading up to his death, he unleashed the Cultural Revolution, an orgy of spiritual and physical violence that deeply scarred the national psyche.Looking back on that history, the ruling party issued a 23,000-word resolution describing Mao as ""a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist"" who made ""gross mistakes"".The verdict is often summarised as ""70 percent right and 30 percent wrong"", a stance that hasn't really shifted even as the reforms instituted by Mao's successor Deng Xiaoping transformed the country, Dikotter said.""You can't really touch upon the whole credibility, reputation, image of Mao, without undermining the foundation of the Communist Party of China.""- 'Sanctioned amnesia' -Under President Xi, the government has gone to ever greater lengths to make sure everyone says the same thing when they talk about Mao.The most powerful leader since the Great Helmsman himself, Xi has cautioned against both ""historical nihilism"" and ""neo-liberalism"", an implicit warning to bury both praise and criticism of Mao's era.""There is an officially-induced and sanctioned amnesia about Mao's true record,"" said Fei-Ling Wang, a China expert at the Georgia Institute of Technology.Criticism of his failures may undermine the government's legitimacy, and last year a Chinese television anchor was suspended after a video surfaced of him criticising the dead leader at a private gathering.But praising his ideology can also be seen as a lament to how far down the capitalist road the country has gone: Chinese officials in January ordered the demolition of a giant, golden statue of the Chairman just days after pictures of its construction appeared online.""Citizens, artists, and activists all have to navigate the grey and shifting boundaries of what's politically permissible,"" said Jessica Chen Weiss, an expert on Chinese politics at New York's Cornell University.- Better than Jesus -For many, Mao's legacy remains highly subjective, said Jeff Wasserstrom, editor of the Oxford Illustrated History of Modern China.An unemployed steelworker might think of ""a more heroic, to him, Mao of the mid-1950s who spoke of labourers being the natural 'masters' of society and promised men like him... jobs for life"", he said.Meanwhile, victims of the Cultural Revolution would see ""a doddering figure who made bad decisions that plunged the country into chaos"", Wasserstrom said.Some Chinese retain an almost God-like reverence for Mao, similar to the cult of personality that once surrounded him, said Li Yaxing, a professor of Mao Zedong Thought at Xiangtan University in the ruler's home town.""No one is perfect. Even the Cultural Revolution was a mistake he made while discovering the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics,"" she said.It was hard to find anyone comparable, she said, adding: ""Even Jesus didn't enjoy such a high reputation.""For Dikotter, China's top leaders' relationship to Mao is more personal than reverential.For them, the chaos of his era is akin to a family secret: ""Most of the leaders and their families were involved in it, including the family of Xi Jinping,"" he said.""All party members have a stake in making sure that history is rarely scrutinised,"" he added.""All of them have a stake in making sure Mao's portrait stays up there.""

'The world will soon witness what eventful steps the DPRK will take to frustrate the hideous and reckless sanctions racket', he said without elaborating.North Korea frequently makes unspecific threats in its state media.       President Donald Trump, who meets his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping this week has warned the US is prepared to act unilaterally to counter the threat from North KoreaThe statement comes ahead of a first face-to-face meeting between Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping this week at the US president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.The comment by the North's foreign ministry spokesman came hours before the US House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill relisting the North as a state sponsor of terror, along with a resolution denouncing the North's nuclear and missile development.The US Treasury hit 11 North Korean business representatives and an industrial firm with sanctions last week, seeking to further isolate the country's economy.Professor Yang Moo-Jin of the University of North Korean Studies said the North is likely to hold off any provocative acts until after the Trump-Xi meeting.'It is most likely to celebrate the 85th anniversary of the birth of its army on April 25 with either a sixth nuclear test, or the launch of a satellite or an ICBM test', Yang said.

94,Trade tensions cast shadow over China web summit,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-6362385/Trade-tensions-cast-shadow-China-web-summit.html," 09:33 BST, 7 November 2018 "," By Cate Cadell WUZHEN, China, Nov 7 (Reuters) - China should have a more prominent role in shaping the future of the global internet, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday in remarks that underscored how battle lines for control of the web have hardened amid a biting trade war with the United States. The official opening of the World Internet Conference, which last year attracted Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet Inc head Sundar Pichai, was more muted this year and did not include previous calls for a more open internet. ""The official speeches spoke a lot less about openness and a lot more about strategic and pragmatic cooperation,"" said Rogier Creemers, a China governance expert at Leiden University in the Netherlands and regular conference attendee. ""It indicates they are less convinced about successful broad-based cooperation, particularly - if not expressed explicitly - with the United States,"" he told Reuters. Xi, like last year, did not attend the event in person in the town of Wuzhen. In a speech read out for him at the event, Xi said there was ""an urgent need for us to speed up the internet economy and work for governance that is more fair and equitable."" China and Xi have pushed for a bigger role in global internet governance even while calling on nations to respect Beijing's ""cyber sovereignty"", an idea that countries should be free to control and censor their internet as they see fit. Technology and the internet are key battlegrounds in a trade war between China and the United States, with a spotlight on U.S. complaints about intellectual property theft and China's ambitions to become a global leader in cutting edge tech. Foreign websites such as Alphabet's Google and Facebook Inc are blocked in China, where authorities also tightly control online content and censor or punish those who post material seen as opposed to ""core socialist values"". Xi's comments come as China's technology and internet firms have taken a hit from rising uncertainty linked to the trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, and also greater involvement of the Chinese state in online industries. While the heads of Apple and Alphabet did not attend this year, conference delegates did hear from the chief executives of U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc and Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. Tencent chief Pony Ma said China's economy was resilient and the country's internet sector had a bright future despite hurdles. Tencent has seen its stock fall nearly 30 percent this year amid a crackdown on gaming, one of its main profit drivers. ""We have suffered from twists and challenges in the past,"" he said. ""Going forward we still want to realize the dream of making China a powerful internet country."" (Reporting by Cate Cadell; Writing by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Darren Schuettler)"

""I don't think the markets are going to do very well.""Stocks in the United States surged after Trump's Nov. 8 election victory. Trump takes office on Friday.""Markets see Trump dismantling regulations and reducing taxes, and that has been the dream,"" said Soros. ""The dream has come true.""But Trump has called for border taxes and withdrawing from his predecessor's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, among other policies that have unclear ramifications for U.S. growth, Soros said.""It's impossible to predict exactly how Trump is going to act,"" he said.Soros, who founded Soros Fund Management LLC and now is chairman of the New York-based firm, was a large contributor to the Super PAC fund-raising group backing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and had donated to other groups supporting Democrats.Overall, Soros said about the president-elect: ""I personally am convinced that he is going to fail. Not because of people like me who would like him to fail. But because his ideas that guide him are inherently self-contradictory and the contradictions are actually already embodied by his advisers ... and his cabinet.""Turning to the United Kingdom, Soros said it is unlikely that Prime Minister Theresa May will ""remain in power"" given divisions within her government.May on Tuesday laid out plans for Britain to negotiate its exit from the European Union. Soros said that process will be long and that ""a bitter divorce"" will hurt both sides.Soros famously made huge profits in 1992 betting against the British pound as it crashed below the preset level and had to be withdrawn from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.China has an interest in European unity because of the bloc's importance as an export market, Soros said.He said President Xi Jinping, who on Tuesday made a case for China's leadership in Davos, can steer his country to either a more open society or a more closed society, while nudging it to a more sustainable economic growth model.""Trump will do more to make China acceptable as a leading member of the international community than the Chinese could do by themselves,"" Soros said.

Since President Xi Jinping came to power, analysts say the Chinese propaganda system has been working with advertisers and PR experts to create content designed to go viral         It is not the first time that Chinese state media has used rap in an effort to make propaganda more catchy, building up a sizable repertoire of songs on government initiatives and catchphrases, like the 'Chinese Dream'70 years in 5 minutes: Chinese democracy in the eyes of an American. #TwoSessions pic.twitter.com/wJDlwzyAKy— China Xinhua News (@XHNews) March 2, 2019  'It's widely acknowledged that a key to China's success is its system of democracy which results in political stability and vitality,' said Colin Linneweber, a Xinhua editor, in the video.Linneweber was later ridiculed on Twitter for his role in the video, with some wondering whether he had been paid, while others criticised it as 'shameful', as the piece emphasises the democratic nature of the National People's Congress, even though many of the bills it votes on are decided by party leaders prior to the session.During last year's political gathering, when the Chinese government moved to abolish presidential term limits - handing Xi a potentially lifelong tenure - the NPC cleared the constitutional amendment with 2,958 in favour and only two against.Linneweber declined to comment.Just last year, Chinese popular culture faced official scrutiny, with rappers being dropped from television shows for bad behavior or content at odds with Communist Party values.Immoral and vulgar content should be kept off the air, including hip-hop and even tattoos, according to China's broadcasting watchdog cited by Reuters.The crackdown on hip-hop, still very much a new genre in China, reflects a broader squeeze on popular culture as the country's stability-focused leadership looks to rein in potential platforms for youthful dissent. Hip hop, Communist style: China uses rap to teach patriotism       Despite China's rumoured crackdown on hip hop, its ruling Communist Party has shown interests in the music genre in the past - so much so that it has used rap to teach patriotism to young people.In 2016, Chinese state media used a rap song to promote Communist theories to youngsters raised under consumerism.The single, called 'Karl Marx is a post-90', was performed by a group of fashionable rappers and devoted to Karl Marx the German author of The Communist Manifesto.The Chinese Communist authority has also released an informative rap video especially for foreigners in order to inform them about 'the real China'.The title, called 'This is China', was produced by a Chinese hip hop group called Chengdu Revolution. "

Xi greeted Modi at a Hubei province museum in the city of Wuhan for what has been billed as an ""informal"" meeting that will continue on Saturday. While last year's high-altitude standoff in the Himalayas has been resolved, the world's most populous countries have a long history of mistrust. New Delhi has also raised concerns about Beijing's Belt and Road initiative, a global trade infrastructure programme that includes a major project through Pakistan-administered Kashmir, disputed territory that New Delhi claims is illegally occupied. Friday's meeting included the museum tour, a meeting and dinner. On Saturday, they will walk along the East Lake, ride a boat and have lunch together, according to the Indian leader's official agenda. ""I hope that the prime minister and I can open a new chapter in Sino-Indian relations during this meeting,"" Xi said, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The Chinese leader said the two sides have established a good working relationship and Beijing was willing to build a closer partnership and cooperation in all fields. ""I want to make our countries' friendly relations ceaselessly grow stronger, to make them rush forward without pause like the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, eternally moving forward,"" Xi said. Modi thanked Xi for meeting him twice outside Beijing, telling the Chinese leader: ""This in itself shows love and affection towards India."" With 40 percent of the world's population, India and China have a responsibility to fix the world's many problems, Modi said, adding that the meeting was a ""great opportunity"" to do so. Invoking Xi's political slogan and his own, Modi said: ""Together your 'new era' dream and our 'new India' effort will be the right step for the benefit of the world."" But neither leader directly mentioned the border row or other sources of tension in their remarks. - Disputed border - The summit ""is New Delhi's well-intentioned attempt to reach out to Beijing to see if the past can be put behind and if the relationship can be reset,"" Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations at King's College in London, told AFP.          India and China say they are committed to solving longstanding border disagreements through dialogue, but progress has been glacial  Both nations say they are committed to solving long-standing border disagreements through dialogue, but progress has been glacial. India and China went to war in 1962 over Arunachal Pradesh, with Chinese troops temporarily capturing part of the Himalayan territory. The dispute remains unresolved: India considers Arunachal Pradesh one of its northeastern states, while China stakes claim to about 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 square miles) of the area. In February, Beijing lodged an angry protest with New Delhi over a trip by Modi to the state. Last year, Indian and Chinese troops faced off on the Doklam plateau, an area high in the Himalayas claimed both by China and by India's ally Bhutan. The dispute began in June when Chinese troops started building a road on the plateau and India deployed troops to stop the project. A crisis was averted in August when the two nuclear-armed nations pulled back. ""We have to step out of the shadows of the 1962 war,"" said Wang Dehua, a South and Central Asia expert at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. ""The meeting will focus on avoiding the unhappy events we saw in Doklam last year,"" Wang said. Modi is expected to return to China in June for the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a security bloc led by Beijing and Moscow. Indian analysts point to a pragmatic reason for Modi to want better relations with China: he faces national elections next year, and he would be better off with stable ties with the world's second-largest economy. ""I don't think he would like to go into an election with the kind of relationship, the low point it had reached over the last year,"" Pant said. With China facing a potential tariff war with the United States, Beijing and New Delhi could find common ground on international trade, Pant added. ""It is one of the issues where India and China have worked together on the global stage in the past,"" he said."
98,Development guru Byer wants China's President Xi to switch focus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4431612/Development-guru-Byer-wants-Chinas-President-Xi-switch-focus.html," 08:09 BST, 21 April 2017 "," By Michael Church HONG KONG, April 21 (Reuters) - Youth development specialist Tom Byer wants Chinese President Xi Jinping to focus the nation's energy on winning the Under 17 World Cup as a first step to achieving China's long-term football goals. Xi sparked the current frenzy within China's football scene when he said it was his dream for China to qualify for, host and win the World Cup. Since then the country's business elite have thrown huge sums of money at the sport, with Chinese Super League clubs spending hundreds of millions of dollars to lure top class foreign talent to the country while others have purchased shares in foreign teams. Byer, though, believes the Chinese need to adopt a different approach and focus on goals that are more achievable. ""I wish Xi Jinping would come out in the media again and say something different,"" said the American coach. ""Not that his dream is to win a World Cup -- although of course he can say that -- but that his other dream is that China wins an Under 17 FIFA World Cup and then people will start investing in the kids. ""Then you could set a goal for 10 years that you want them to do well in an under 17 World Cup."" China has not appeared at the FIFA Under 17 World Cup since 2005, a year after winning the Asian Under 16 Championship for only the second time. Byer points to Japan's success in reaching the Under 20 World Cup final in Nigeria in 1999, when a team featuring several of the squad that would go on to play at the senior World Cup in 2002 and 2006 lost out to a Spain side featuring future Barcelona icon Xavi Hernandez. ""Look at Japan, they played in the final of the Under 20 World Cup against Spain and it helped them a lot,"" said Byer. ""I would rather see China focus on the Under 17s because it's a 'no brainer'. ""Competition-wise it's not unrealistic and people could get behind that, and secondly it's every two years, so there's a two-year cycle that you can get behind. The billionaires would be tripping over themselves to invest."" '200 MILLION EYEBALLS' Byer has been brought on board by China's education ministry to help implement the country's plans to bring football into the national curriculum. The latest phase of his work will kick off next month when videos featuring the New York-born coach will begin to be broadcast daily on the China Education Television network. He has enlisted the help of former Manchester United and England star David Beckham to promote the television spots, which will be shown on a network that has the potential to reach tens of millions of students. ""Because football has become compulsory in schools, you have six-year-olds starting to play football, but you also have 15 and 16-year-olds starting to play, so I told the ministry of education that the technical age of those players is the same,"" said Byer. ""The whole idea is based on what I did in Japan. You need a media component that can speak to millions of kids. It's got potentially 200 million eyeballs on it and they're talking about piping it into the classrooms."" Byer has worked on similar programmes in Japan -- where he has been based for close to three decades -- but he stresses it is difficult to compare the two countries. ""Japan is so different, the cultures are so different,"" he said. ""Sport is seen as part of education, not as a distraction as it is in China. ""What we are doing today, you're not going to see a major difference for 10 or 15 years. But it also depends on deciding what is success. ""For me, I try to manage expectations and tell people you can't measure it by how many World Cup tournaments China might or might not perform in, but you can determine it by how they are performing at the Asian Under 16 tournament.""

99,China law criminalizes attacks on revolutionary heroes,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5663711/China-law-criminalize-attacks-revolutionary-heroes.html," 08:03 BST, 27 April 2018 "," BEIJING (AP) - China passed a law Friday making it a crime to attack revolutionary heroes and martyrs as the ruling Communist Party steps up efforts to police historical discussions and enforce ideology. The new law bans criticism or questioning of the folklore surrounding the 1949 formation of the People's Republic by Communist revolutionaries, and also prohibits acts that glorify historical episodes considered unpatriotic, such as Japan's 20th century invasion of China. The notice on the law's passage by the standing committee of the rubber-stamp National People's Congress did not specify penalties but said violators would be pursued by the authorities. Since taking power in 2012, President Xi Jinping has called for tighter ideological discipline across society and enhanced patriotic education. Academics who criticized Mao Zedong have been silenced or sacked, while propaganda authorities have rolled out a series of polished media campaigns reminding citizens of the party's historical accomplishments. In November, the legislature made disrespecting the national anthem, a Communist-inspired hymn called ""The March of the Volunteers,"" a criminal offense punishable by up to three years in prison. The moves follow Xi's appointment to a second five-year term as party leader, for which he has touted a vision of achieving a ""Chinese Dream"" of a powerful, prosperous nation that allows no challenge to ruling party authority. Dissident intellectuals say the measures further constrict the space for open discussion about China's history, leaving the party line irreproachable by default. Stories detailing Communist sacrifices against the Japanese make up significant parts of the party's founding narrative, although outside historians question the party's overall contribution to victory in 1945. The ""Heroes and Martyrs Protection Law"" was foreshadowed in 2016, when a Beijing court ordered a historian to apologize for two essays that questioned whether the story of the ""Five Heroes of Langya Mountain"" - Communist soldiers who leapt to their death from a mountain peak instead of surrendering to Japanese troops - really took place. The liberal journal that published the article, Yanhuang Chunqiu, was effectively shuttered by authorities that year. In February, Chinese police ordered two men detained for 15 days after they posted pictures on the internet of themselves wearing Japanese World War II army uniforms at the site of one of the war's worst atrocities. Earlier this week, a flurry of state media reports endorsing the proposal presaged its passage. The state-run Legal Daily quoted a lawmaker, Liu Xiuwen, as saying that the law embodied the spirit of Xi's ""new era"" thinking to bring about Chinese historical rejuvenation."

Ever since the Chinese Football Association announced last month it had coaxed Italian veteran Marcello Lippi, out of retirement, the nation¿s long-suffering fans have responded with more than a hint of skepticism. Given the team¿s record of failure under multiple foreign and Chinese coaches, the problems are more often attributed to the lack of a strong youth program, long-term planning and a failure to find the raw material to forge a winning team. (AP Photo, File) ""I would rather hire more good coaches for youth training,"" added Yi, a salesman, who attended a game last week at Shanghai's Hongkou stadium. ""I can't see hope for the next 10 years.""Ever since the Chinese Football Association announced last month it had coaxed Lippi out of retirement, the national team's long-suffering fans have greeted the news with indifference, cynicism, and even a hint of outrage.Rather than celebrating the appointment of the most high-profile coach China has ever had, some supporters have balked at the size of Lippi's rumored contract.A popular joke circulating on the Wechat messaging service compares it with ""a nouveau riche family hiring a Harvard professor to tutor their kid.""Given the team's record of failure under a string of foreign and Chinese coaches, the problems are more often attributed to the lack of a strong youth program and a misplaced, money-driven focus on the domestic league.Lippi was hired to replace Gao Hongbo, who quit after a 2-0 loss in Uzbekistan last month left China with one point from four qualifying matches and with little hope of making it to Russia in 2018. China has qualified for one World Cup — the 2002 edition co-hosted by Japan and South Korea — where it bounced out in the group stage without scoring a goal.Fed up with such results and seeking to close a glaring gap in its international sporting prowess, China this year announced an ambitious football development plan closely identified with President Xi Jinping, a fan of the game. The plan envisions 50 million players joining in the game by the end of the decade and the transformation of the country into a ""first-rate major footballing power"" by 2050.The blueprint is seen as another aspect of Xi's grand narrative of national rejuvenation — dubbed his ""China Dream"" — that is generally a point of pride for the public. Yet the mixed reactions to Lippi's appointment reflect a deep cynicism when it comes to supporting a football team that is ranked 84th and which also recently lost to Syria.Though Xi's administration has been applauded for proposing to build academies and thousands of football fields, the politically-tinged directive has also spurred the domestic league into spending extravagantly on foreign stars and big-name managers. That has prompted talk of a bubble that will burst before any benefits trickle down to the grassroots.Against that backdrop have been reports in Italian and Chinese media that Lippi would be paid a record salary of 20 million euros a year.The former Juventus and Italy coach told Italian reporters last week the figures were exaggerated, but that hasn't quieted grumbles about yet another football import taking money that could be spent developing Chinese youngsters.Ma Dexing, one of China's best-known football commentators, said Xi's campaign, with its intended emphasis on developing youth, was already ""losing its way"" amid China's frenzy of flashy managerial hires and exorbitant player purchases. But Ma said hiring Lippi was justified at whatever cost.""His situation is different,"" Ma said in an interview. ""The national team is the dragon's head — the symbolic leader. If it doesn't do well, everyone else loses interest in football.""Lippi, who guided Italy to World Cup success in 2006, coached Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande from 2012 to 2015, winning domestic titles and the Asian Champions League. Rather than serve merely as another foreign figurehead, Ma said, Lippi has the authority and the experience of working in China to truly overhaul the country's football organization.""In the past they changed the water but not the medicine,"" Ma said. ""This is a real revolution.""In his first meeting with the Chinese media as national coach, Lippi said his top task would be to evaluate his players' psychology and boost their confidence, rather than introduce new tactics. He said it was highly improbable for China to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, but urged the nation to back his players.Mark Dreyer, a Beijing-based British sports commentator on China Central Television, said in some ways China resembled England, a country also locked in a perennial cycle of high short-term expectations and intense pressure on the national team, followed by disappointment and cynicism. Chinese football authorities need more independence to do their work, Dreyer said.""They need someone who can come in and say, 'Give me 20 years, you can't expect results in two years just because you want them,'"" Dreyer said. ""But how can they suddenly be free from the government and not answering to Xi Jinping?""Others are less positive. Outside Shanghai's Hongkou stadium, property manager Xu Chao said he preferred watching local club Shenhua because the national team's level of play was simply ""unwatchable.""""It's useless to hire an expensive coach when the team's foundation is not good,"" Xu said.Yan Shihao, a junior in university, said it wasn't just China making a costly bet by hiring Lippi.""Lippi chose China,"" he said.

Brazilian World Cup-winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, seen during a training session of China's Guangzhou Evergrande team, ahead of their AFC Champions League final match in Foshan, southern China's Guangdong province, on November 20, 2015 ©- (AFP/File) The ex-Portugal and Chelsea boss now returns to the global stage at the Club World Cup, where Evergrande will meet Spanish uber-team Barcelona if they win their opening match against Mexico's Club America on Sunday.In the background are moves to revolutionise football in China, a country which has so far been better known for watching rather than playing the sport with huge viewing figures for European leagues.But under football fan President Xi Jinping, China has its eyes on hosting and even winning a World Cup, while football has been mandated at more and more schools.China's most ambitious club -- full name Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao -- have proved a good fit for the resurgent Scolari, 67, who departed the Selecao after their thumping 7-1 World Cup semi-final defeat to Germany, before a brief stint at Gremio.- 'I feel quite extraordinary' -""The winners are those that will not give up,"" said the jubilant Brazilian, after hoisting the AFC Champions League trophy last month.""My next target is the (Club World Cup). Why not? I have a great team at a great club and great players –- I can realise this dream,"" he said.""In life we have happy days and not so happy days, but tonight it has been a wonderful night. I've had a few great moments before and tonight, I feel quite extraordinary.""Scolari is handsomely compensated for his work in Guangzhou, a bustling metropolis of 8.5 million people not far from Hong Kong, where he rakes in a reported salary of $5 million.Money seems no object for some clubs in the world's second biggest economy, where Mano Menezes this week arrived at Shandong Luneng as the third ex-Brazil boss in China -- reportedly on even more money than Scolari.But Evergrande, jointly owned by Internet giant Alibaba and one of China's biggest real estate firms, have been in a league of their own when it comes to splashing out on foreign talent.Former Real Madrid striker Robinho arrived in July, following in the footsteps of ex-Spurs midfielder Paulinho (14 million euros, $15.4 million) and another Brazilian, striker Ricardo Goulart, who signed for a Chinese record 15 million euros in January.Scolari is also Evergrande's third big-name coach of recent times, after fellow World Cup-winner Marcello Lippi, who led them to the 2013 Asian crown, and the brief tenure of Fabio Cannavaro.- Barbecue houses -The thick-set Brazilian appears popular with his players, who bounced him up and down -- with some difficulty -- after the Champions League win, and say Evergrande are ""transformed"" under his watch.""Two years ago, we were very much an attack-minded team under Lippi. But now with Scolari in charge, our team has been transformed into a new side,"" said midfielder Huang Bowen.""We have more balance between defence and attack. We remain an offensively strong side and our back-line has become more solid. We have entered a new level.""Even so, Scolari's biggest test may yet be in negotiating the notorious complexities of Chinese football -- an environment where discretion and cultural sensitivity count for as much as football know-how.Evergrande chairman Xu Jiayin enjoys a relationship of some significance with president Xi, and accompanied the head of state on his October visit to Britain.However the vastly experienced Scolari, who has held nearly 20 head coaching positions in his career, is showing he knows how to win off the pitch in China as well as on it.""Who is the leader of China? Of course I know it is Xi Jinping,"" Scolari told the Southern Daily.""I know... Xi is a football lover and has already made big efforts to improve the development of football in China.""However, not everything in Guangzhou is to Scolari's taste -- the coach has lamented the ""lack of authentic Brazilian barbecue houses"" in the southern Chinese city.

105,China's answer to anthem disrespect: up to 3 years in prison,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5049275/China-says-insulting-anthem-criminal-punishable-jail.html," 10:29 BST, 4 November 2017 "," BEIJING (AP) - China's rubber-stamp legislature on Saturday made disrespecting the national anthem a criminal offense punishable by up to three years in prison amid rising nationalist appeals from the ruling Communist Party under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed an amendment to the country's criminal law outlining punishments for people found ""seriously"" disrespecting the national anthem in public. The move follows Xi's appointment to a second five-year term as party leader, for which he has touted a vision of achieving a ""Chinese Dream"" of a powerful, prosperous nation. It also comes as the anthem, ""March of the Volunteers,"" has in recent months been a political flashpoint in the southern Chinese city of Hong Kong, where tensions are rising over Beijing's efforts to assert its authority over the territory.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)  According to the amendment passed Saturday in Beijing, penalties include detention, imprisonment of up to three years and the deprivation of political rights. Such punishments previously applied to the desecration of the national flag and emblem in public, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported. The legislature also moved to apply a separate, recently passed law on the national anthem to Hong Kong and Macau, Chinese semiautonomous regions with separate legal systems. Soccer fans in Hong Kong have booed the anthem when it's played at games between the home team and teams from China or other countries, leading to fines from FIFA, the sport's governing body. Pro-democracy activists and lawmakers fear a national anthem law could be used to undermine freedom of speech in Hong Kong. The National Anthem Law, which came into effect in October, stated that playing the anthem on occasions deemed improper, including funerals, or for changing its wording or presenting it in a disrespectful manner could be punished with 15 days in detention. China's legislature adopted a decision to include the law in Hong Kong's and Macau's mini-constitutions, known in each territory as the Basic Law. Xinhua cited Zhang Rongshun, deputy director of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the top parliamentary body, as saying it was ""urgent and important"" to apply the anthem law in Hong Kong to address recent incidents. ""In recent years, incidents of disrespecting the national anthem had occurred in Hong Kong, challenging the bottom line of the principle of 'one country, two systems' and social morality, and triggering rage among Chinese, including most Hong Kong residents,"" Zhang said. Since his appointment as party leader in 2012, Xi has established a growing cult of personality that leans heavily on his image as a patriotic leader who brooks no slight to national dignity. Hallmarks of his term in office have included a stronger military, bolder foreign policy and aggressive economic expansion abroad, as well as sharply reduced space for criticism or political dissent at home."
106,China holds ceremony to mark China-Japan war,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2682872/China-holds-ceremony-mark-China-Japan-war.html," 11:06 BST, 7 July 2014 ","China holds ceremony to mark China-Japan war By Associated Press   Published: 11:06 BST, 7 July 2014  |  Updated: 11:06 BST, 7 July 2014                e-mail         BEIJING (AP) — President Xi Jinping criticized people who ""beautify the history of aggression"" as China on Monday marked the 77th anniversary of the start of a war with Japan amid rising tensions between Beijing and Tokyo.This year's unusually high-profile commemoration of the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident, including a nationally televised speech by Xi, comes amid an anti-Japanese propaganda campaign by Beijing.The two governments are involved in a dispute over ownership of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. China has expressed unease about Japan's reinterpretation of its pacifist constitution to ease restrictions on military activity. While the change has met with opposition within Japan, it has been supported by the United States and Australia, where Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was due to visit Monday.""Unfortunately, nearly 70 years after the victory of the Chinese war of resistance against Japanese aggression and the anti-Fascist war, there is still a minority group of people who ignore historical facts, who ignore the tens of thousands of lives lost in the war, who go against the tide of history and deny and even beautify the history of aggression and harm international mutual trust and create regional tension,"" Xi said at a ceremony at suburban Beijing's Lugou Bridge, called the Marco Polo Bridge in the 1930s.Asked about the commemoration, Japan's chief government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said China's attempt to dredge up wartime history and turn it into an international issue was unnecessary and ""not helpful at all in building peace and cooperation in the region.""Suga said Japan has been recognized by the international community for being a peaceful nation since the end of World War II.""We will continue our contribution to international peace and prosperity and to building a forward-looking relationship,"" he said.Rana Mitter, a professor of Chinese history and politics at Oxford University, said Xi's speech fit into a pattern of attempts by China to highlight Chinese wartime resistance against Japan to ""inspire patriotic fervor.""""It's really part of a growing tendency that we have seen, notably in the last few months, of attempts by China and the Chinese leadership to use events from the Second World War period to make points about contemporary geopolitics, particularly if they relate to Japan,"" he said.Xi unveiled a commemorative sculpture based on a military medal at the Museum of the War of the Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.After Xi spoke, a group of schoolchildren at the event chanted a promise to ""remember history, cherish peace, not forget the shame of the nation and realize the Chinese dream.""In 1937, Japanese forces that had been in China's northeast since 1905 provoked a clash with Chinese soldiers at the Marco Polo Bridge by trying to enter the city of Wanping near Beijing. The fighting is regarded as the first battle of the second Sino-Japanese war, which lasted until Japan's defeat by the Allies in 1945.China and Japan are now linked by billions of dollars in trade, investment and aid, but the ruling Communist Party uses state media and school history textbooks to keep alive anti-Japanese sentiment.Relations worsened after Abe visited a shrine in Tokyo late last year that honors Japan's war dead, including convicted war criminals.Soon after, officials at Japanese broadcaster NHK drew fire when one denied that the 1937 massacre in Nanjing of thousands of Chinese civilians by Japanese soldiers happened and another downplayed the Imperial Army's use of sex slaves.In recent months, Beijing has tried to draw foreign attention to Japanese wartime aggression.Last month, the government said it was applying to the U.N. cultural organization UNESCO to have 11 sets of documents relating to the Nanjing Massacre, including diaries, photographs and testimonies that depict Japan's brutality, declared important historical material.Last week, China posted documents online that it said were personal accounts of wartime atrocities committed by Japanese in China.On Sunday, China launched a website to promote commemoration of the Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking.Throughout the day Sunday, China Central Television's hourly news showed the recollections of a sobbing 85-year-old man of being forced to work in a Japanese iron mine during the war. Yu Mingting spoke about harsh living conditions and said when there was no room to bury the bodies of dead Chinese, Japanese poured gasoline on them and burned them.On Monday, state television showed scenes from a 1956 trial of Japanese war criminals, with victims angrily and tearfully recounting their experiences.___Associated Press videojournalist Miki Toda in Tokyo contributed to this report."
107,North Korea nuclear test rocks parts of China,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4847896/North-Korea-nuclear-test-rocks-parts-China.html," 08:50 BST, 3 September 2017 ","          South Korean officials monitor screens showing a graph of seismic waves originating from North Korea, at the Korea Meteorological Administration in Seoul on September 3, 2017  North Korea's nuclear test Sunday was widely felt in northeast China and rocked some cities for as long as eight seconds, according to reports and accounts on social media. The tremor was felt as far away as the city of Changchun around 400 km (250 miles) northwest of the North's test site at Punggye-ri, according to state broadcaster CCTV. In the small city of Yanji, some 20 km from the border, some people reported the shaking was so intense that they fled their homes. Jiemiao Cangxin, a commentator on the Chinese microblog Weibo, said his building swayed so much that ""I put my underpants on and I just ran, and when I reached the first floor I can say I wasn't the only one running away with just my underpants on!"" ""In Yanji, we felt the shaking for ten seconds,"" said Weibo user Buziranshaonv. ""I was lying down and sleeping when the tremor woke me up. At first, I thought it was a dream,"" said another. The test, North Korea's sixth, was substantially larger than previous ones, measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale according to US monitors. That would make it between five to six times larger than Pyongyang's previous effort in September last year, according to South Korea's weather agency. The North called it a test of a hydrogen bomb which was a ""perfect success"". Reports of the explosion also provoked widespread concern further away in China, with many commentators speculating about the timing of the event -- just hours before Chinese President Xi Jinping is due to open a summit of BRICs nations in southern China. ""An earthquake happened in North Korea, everyone thinks at once it is a nuclear test,"" said one user, cheekily adding ""is it a form of greetings for the summit in Xiamen?"""
108,Chinese plead for Canada to let them immigrate,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2572912/Chinese-plead-Canada-let-immigrate.html," 13:14 BST, 4 March 2014 ","Chinese plead for Canada to let them immigrate By Associated Press   Published: 13:14 BST, 4 March 2014  |  Updated: 13:14 BST, 4 March 2014                e-mail         BEIJING (AP) — Chinese millionaires on Tuesday pleaded for the Canadian government not to throw away the immigration applications of thousands of Chinese nationals as part of its plans to end a backlogged investor program.At a news conference, 10 investor applicants delivered their crestfallen message — that their faith in Canada as a ""trustworthy country,"" with its attractive rule of law, environment and welfare system, was wavering.Last month, Canada announced its intention to terminate its immigrant investor program and eliminate the longstanding backlog of applications — amounting to more than 65,000 people, most of whom are Chinese. It said immigrant investors pay less in taxes than other immigrants and are less likely to stay in Canada over the medium to long term.Investor applicants, some of whom had applied five years ago, said they were discussing their options with lawyers in Canada and whether to claim compensation for the years they had been waiting.As China's top leaders meet during this week's ceremonial legislature, the National People's Congress, it is a reminder that all is not well at home, and suggests for some citizens, the ""Chinese dream"" that President Xi Jinping talks about is to be found on other shores.Shanghai-based Duan Wuhong said for her, Canada's education system, environment, social welfare and rule of law were pull factors. But she added: ""The most important thing is the government is trusted. This is the most important thing for us to choose Canada.""She said at the time of her application she had considered other countries including the U.S. ""Applying to Canada is the worst decision I have made in my life. Before I thought it was the best.""Immigration consultant Larry Wang said that Canadian government's policy was ""unjustified"" and the investor applicants want Canada to ""correct its mistake.""""They are not refugees. They can have a very good life in China. They just want to have a better life in Canada,"" said Wang, a Beijing-born Canadian.Wang said it was Canada's right to stop its investor program, but it should not disqualify candidates who had already applied.Program applicants had to have a net worth of 1.6 million Canadian dollars ($1.4 million) and invest 400,000 Canadian dollars, or $800,000 if they applied after 2010, which would be returned after about five years without interest.Father-of-two Yu Qingxin, who manages commercial buildings, schools and hospitals in China, said he had already bought a house in west Vancouver for nearly $2 million Canadian dollars ($1.8 million) in preparation to emigrate. The most impressive thing about Canada, said Yu, is its ""sense of morality.""Another applicant, Du Jun, said he had moved his child out of the Chinese school system to a Canadian school near Beijing. Now, after two years studying at this school, it is almost impossible for his child to return to the Chinese education system, he said."

In his book, The Art Of The Deal, published three decades ago, he wrote: ‘My style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward. I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I’m after.’At first glance, Trump’s style of pushing and pushing at China with threats of sky-high tariffs on trade looks as though it has paid off.He got his way after a lock-down dinner in Buenos Aires at the G20 summit with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, when they finally agreed a 90-day truce in their trade war to allow more time for jaw-jaw.         Table talk: President Trump sits down with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at a lock-down dinner in Buenos Aires The truce was enough of a victory to send US and European financial markets into spasms of relief, with some analysts predicting a pre-Christmas rally through December.Trump as Santa is not what most people expect of the president. Yet he has agreed to defer his plan to raise the tariff on $200billion of Chinese imports from 10 per cent to 25 per cent, for 90 days so that talks can continue.In exchange, Xi promised to buy a ‘very substantial’ amount of US goods, including farm, energy and industrial products which will help reduce the big trade gap between the two countries.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Stock market leaps as investors around the world breathe a...

Share this article Share   This is just what Trump wanted, as boosting trade for US farmers and manufacturers was a pivotal part to his electoral pitch.There’s another plus. Cracking down on China economically is perhaps Trump’s only main policy for which there is support from the Democrats.What’s not clear is whether his claim that Beijing will also ‘reduce and remove’ tariffs below the 40pc level that it charges on the imports of US cars is correct.For now, the truce gives both sides some claim to victory. But the truth is this agreement is a de-escalation of the trade war rather than any ceasefire. There’s a much bigger battle at stake in Trump’s war on China as the president has grander ambitions than cutting the trade deficit. He wants to throttle China’s position as a rival superpower by shattering its industrial base and tearing up its recent ‘Made in China 2025’ programme. He has made no bones about accusing China of stealing US intellectual property, and wants to put a stop to this alleged theft. He also wants to end China’s dream of dominating industries such as car making. China’s latest ambition is to be the world’s biggest electric car-maker.China is already feeling the pain of a weaker economy. The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen almost a third since the start of the year. Xi, who faces criticism for miscalculating Trump’s threats, is said to be willing do anything to avoid US tariffs as the country’s growth stalls.And Trump? He will keep pushing.   Walmsley’s bold moveEmma Walmsley also has the makings of a formidable deal-maker. By swapping a night-time drinks company for one of the most cutting-edge cancer drugs on the market, she’s catapulted GSK to the forefront of cancer genetic research.The GSK chief sold Horlicks for £3billion and is paying £4billion to buy the US cancer company Tesaro, all on the same day. Some swap. Tesaro makes Zejula, an approved drug for treating ovarian cancer. Zejula belongs to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors, which work by blocking enzymes involved in repairing damaged DNA, thus helping to kill cancer cells.It’s a bold move and precisely the long-term ambition that we hope for from companies like GSK.If it turns out that Zejula can also be used to treat breast, lung and prostate cancers as GSK believes, then this could prove to be a master-stroke for Walmsley. It also shows she does what she says, having promised to put GSK back on the drugs after years of lagging behind rivals in finding new blockbusters.With big pharma like GSK behind it, Zejula could save more lives too.Courgette warsWaitrose is blaming the rioting in France by the ‘gilets jaunes’ (yellow vests), who are protesting over fuel price rises, for a shortage of courgettes.Trucks carrying courgettes from Spain can’t get to the UK because of the protests.We can cope without courgettes for a few days but has President Macron met his Waterloo?He is getting close to a state of emergency and the street-fighting is spreading.

110,Handling of U.S. trade dispute causes rift in Chinese leadership - sources,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-6042559/Handling-U-S-trade-dispute-causes-rift-Chinese-leadership--sources.html," 08:43 BST, 9 August 2018 "," By Ben Blanchard and Kevin Yao BEIJING, Aug 9 (Reuters) - A growing trade war with the United States is causing rifts within China's Communist Party, with some critics saying that an overly nationalistic Chinese stance may have hardened the U.S. position, according to four sources close to the government. President Xi Jinping still has a firm grip on power, but an unusual surge of criticism about economic policy and how the government has handled the trade war has revealed rare cracks in the ruling Communist Party. A backlash is being felt at the highest levels of the government, possibly hitting a close aide to Xi, his ideology chief and strategist Wang Huning, according to two sources familiar with discussions in leadership circles. A prominent and influential academic whose views have found favour in some party quarters has also come under attack for his strident views on Chinese power. Wang, who was the architect of the ""China Dream"", Xi's vision for China to become a strong and prosperous nation, has been taken to task by the Chinese leader for crafting an excessively nationalistic image for the country, which has only provoked the United States, the sources said. ""He's in trouble for mishandling the propaganda and hyping up China too much,"" said one of the sources, who has ties to China's leadership and propaganda system. The office of the party's spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on Wang and his relationship with Xi, or on whether China had erred in its messaging in the trade war. There is a growing feeling within the Chinese government that the outlook for China has ""become grim"", according to a government policy advisor, following the deterioration in relations between China and the United States over trade. The advisor requested anonymity. Those feelings are also shared by other influential voices. ""Many economists and intellectuals are upset about China's trade war policies,"" an academic at a Chinese policy think tank told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. ""The overarching view is that China's current stance has been too hard-line and the leadership has clearly misjudged the situation."" That view contrasts with the thinking at the beginning of the year of many Chinese academics who had touted China's ability to withstand the trade row in the face of Trump's perceived political weakness at home. China thought it had reached a deal with Washington in May to avoid a trade war, but was shocked when the Trump administration, in Beijing's eyes, went back on that agreement. ""The evolution from a trade conflict to trade war has made people rethink things,"" the policy advisor said. ""This is seen as being related to the exaggeration of China's strength by some Chinese institutions and scholars that have influenced the U.S. perceptions and even domestic views."" One official who is familiar with China's propaganda efforts said the messaging had gone astray. ""In the trade war, the line of thinking in the propaganda has been that Trump is crazy,"" said the official. ""In fact, what he is scared of is us getting strong."" CONFIDENT CHINA? Under Xi, officials have become increasingly confident in proclaiming what they see as China's rightful place as a world leader, casting off a long-held maxim of Deng Xiaoping, the former paramount leader who said the country needed to ""bide its time and hide its strength"". That confidence has been apparent as the government pushes its Belt and Road initiative to develop trade routes between East and West and takes a hard line on territorial issues such as the South China Sea and Taiwan. Hu Angang, an economics professor at Tsinghua University and an expert in the field of ""Chinese exceptionalism"", is one prominent advocate for the view that China has achieved ""comprehensive national power"". In recent weeks, Hu has faced a public backlash, with critics blaming him for making the United States wary of China by trumpeting and exaggerating its relative economic, technical and military might. That view of Hu is also shared by some people in official circles, according to the policy advisor. Hu declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The cracks within the party come as China's stock markets and currency have slumped, and the government has struggled to shore up the economy to cushion the impact of the trade war. China in recent weeks has encouraged more lending and pledged to use fiscal policy - including tax cuts and more funding for local governments - to combat slowing economic growth and rising uncertainty driven in part by the escalating trade war. Xi has had other fires to hose too, including public anger over a vaccine fraud case and protests in Beijing this week by investors in failed online lending platforms. Meanwhile, top leaders are believed to be meeting for secretive annual talks, most likely at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, leaving a policy vacuum as Xi and other officials all but vanish from state media. Based on what has happened in previous years, that could be for up to two weeks. It is unclear if Wang, the propaganda boss, will face any consequences, and there may be other reasons for the tensions within the party related to him. A third source with ties to the leadership told Reuters the tension had to do with Wang opposing a cult of personality that has been forming around Xi. Wang still features in state media and diplomats and leadership sources say he is unlikely to be removed from the Standing Committee, the party body that runs China, in what would be an unprecedented move. Though official media has in recent days been filled with defiant commentary regarding the United States and the trade war, there have been signs of a shift in China's messaging. Beijing has begun downplaying Made in China 2025, the state-backed industrial policy that is core to Washington's complaints about the country's technological ambitions. State television's English-language news channel CGTN, which is aimed at foreigners, has also been focusing on how ordinary Americans will be affected by more expensive prices for cheap made-in-China consumer goods and the damage tariffs will do to the U.S. economy. But the thinking in Chinese government circles is that the damage has already been done - and that China has learned the hard way that its domestic propaganda is now being scrutinised abroad in a way it never was before. ""It's impossible for China to 'bide its time and hide its strength', but at least we can control the volume of our own propaganda and tell China's story the proper way,"" the policy insider said. ""When the size of China's economy was small, it got little outside attention but China is now closely watched.""

111,Chinese KHL team off to modest start with eye on '22 Games,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3828103/Chinese-KHL-team-modest-start-eye-22-Games.html," 03:03 BST, 8 October 2016 ","Chinese KHL team off to modest start with eye on '22 Games By Associated Press   Published: 03:03 BST, 8 October 2016  |  Updated: 03:03 BST, 8 October 2016                e-mail         ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) — Few professional sports teams had grander beginnings than Kunlun Red Star.With Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping looking on, China's biggest venture in hockey to date joined the Kontinental Hockey League in June at a lavish ceremony in Beijing. For the Russia-based KHL, Kunlun is a chance to beat the NHL to the Chinese market. Chinese officials hope the club can groom enough talent to strengthen its feeble national team in time for the Beijing Olympics in 2022.""This project was organized at the highest level,"" said Vladimir Yurzinov Jr., Kunlun's Russian coach. ""It's good that we're first because if it wasn't us (in the Chinese market), it would be the North Americans.""China offers a vast potential fan base for foreign sports leagues, but there are challenges in turning interest into revenue.English Premier League soccer is the biggest success story, having built a dedicated Chinese following in part by playing preseason games in Hong Kong. That has helped to push its global TV rights deals to record levels. The Women's Tennis Association now hosts some of its most lucrative events there, thanks to the breakout popularity of Chinese player Li Na, while the British-based sport of snooker has also reversed its fortunes by finding a younger audience in China.Still, Tom Doctoroff, an U.S.-based expert on marketing in China, cautioned that hockey has limited potential in China because it is ""too overtly aggressive"" for Chinese consumers, and persuading them to pay to watch sports broadcasts is difficult.""Free remains the frame of reference for most consumers,"" he said in an email.That hasn't stopped Kunlun from rushing through a summer of recruitment and training to create a club in record time. The team is off a sobering start to life in the KHL, widely considered the world's second-strongest league.Kunlun had lost three in a row when it arrived for a recent game at SKA St. Petersburg, which had ex-NHL stars Slava Voynov and Ilya Kovalchuk on the ice. There were a few giggles when the announcer asked fans to stand for the Chinese anthem, and SKA barely had to sweat for a 3-0 win as Kunlun's Canadian and European import players struggled to deal with one of the strongest rosters outside the NHL.The KHL sprawls across eight countries and nine time zones, meaning players face a punishing schedule of long flights across Eastern Europe and Asia. That's a new world for ex-Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Brett Bellemore, who had never left North America until he joined Kunlun before the season. For Bellemore, the move was more about seeing the world with his new wife, Natasha, than the financial side of playing in China.""I'd never even had jetlag before,"" he said. ""It's been a bit of a ride, but it's been exciting.""Kunlun boasts players from nine countries, ranging from 36-year-old NHL veteran Alexei Ponikarovsky to young Chinese players just starting their careers. Among them is Rudi Ying, an 18-year-old who grew up in the United States after moving there at age 10 to pursue his dream of being a professional hockey player.Spreading hockey beyond China's wealthier classes will be hard, given the cost of equipment and facilities. Right now, soccer is attracting the lion's share of government and private funds, with President Xi the country's No. 1 fan.""I've had one foot in either culture,"" said Ying, who comes from a privileged background. ""It helps me to see how far behind Chinese hockey is. China's not to blame, it's just a sport that's not very popular ... We don't have much time to catch up.""Despite the political fanfare around Kunlun in Russia and China, club spokesman Oleg Vinokurov said no government money is involved and funding comes from Russian and Chinese companies. So far, there are mixed signals on the success of the fledgling team: While almost 8,000 people watched Kunlun win its first home game in Beijing, a game at its secondary arena in Shanghai attracted just 550 fans.For the KHL, moving into Asia is something of a plan B after its westward expansion into Europe stalled, with several teams experiencing chronic financial difficulties. The long-term aim is for Kunlun to be the basis for the Chinese national team, just as CSKA Moscow was for the Soviet Union.Yurzinov said part of his mission as Kunlun coach is to improve the Chinese players on his roster with mentoring from older teammates and simply ""practice after practice."" The focus is firmly on developing local talent, not attracting foreigners to represent China in international play, as 2018 Olympic host South Korea has done.If it can't improve the national team by 2022, China will be the first Olympic host not to take part in the men's tournament. The national team was pounded 9-0 by the Netherlands earlier this year and will play next year's world championship in Division II B, competing against the likes of Mexico and North Korea.Ying will be 23 when the 2022 Olympics take place and hopes he will be a star on home ice for the Chinese national team. He worries the timetable is just too tight, even with Kunlun spawning a new generation.""The reason we created this organization to try to help promote Chinese hockey is because one person can't do it,"" he said. ""If 2022 comes around and I'm the only one who's at that level, it's not going to be enough."""

Russia denies the accusations.China and the United States also have jousted over differing visions of how to achieve Asia-Pacific trade integration, adding to persistent discord over commerce, human rights, US accusations of Chinese cyber-espionage, and the territorial disputes.Beijing's growing territorial assertiveness in the South China Sea also has rankled rival claimants to parts of the strategic waterway.It will be all smiles, however, when the APEC leaders gather Monday for the annual ""family photo,"" typically wearing the host's national dress. This year's fashion choice remains a mystery.The event culminates Tuesday with a formal leaders' summit.China is hosting APEC for the first time since 2001, when it was still re-emerging as a world economic power.But in a speech Sunday, Xi underlined how much has changed by offering his vision of an ""Asia-Pacific dream"" in which China's continued rise offers ""infinite promise"" to all.

Last year, defence spending rose 12.2 percent to $130 billion, second only to the United States.That continued a nearly unbroken two-decade run of double-digit budget increases, although many experts think China's real defence outlays are much larger.China's leaders have routinely sought to justify the country's military modernisation by linking defence spending to rapid GDP growth. But growth of 7.4 percent last year was the slowest in 24 years, and a further slowdown to around 7 percent is expected in 2015.Other factors would now keep defence spending high, from the U.S. military and diplomatic ""rebalancing"" to Asia to Xi's crackdown on corruption in the People's Liberation Army, which has caused some disquiet in the ranks, military experts said.""Xi has put a premium on the 'dream of a strong military' as part of his grand strategy for China's rise, perhaps more than any other modern (Chinese) leader,"" said Zhang Baohui, a security specialist at Hong Kong's Lingnan University.""This greater emphasis on the military is very significant.""Indeed, troops are rehearsing for a major parade in September where the PLA is expected to unveil new homegrown weapons in the first of a series of public displays of military might planned during Xi's tenure, sources have told Reuters.U.S. ALLIANCES RANKLEAt the forefront of the minds of China's strategic military planners is the U.S. rebalancing, which among other things calls for 60 percent of U.S. warships to be based in the Asia Pacific by 2020, up from about 50 percent.""The adjustment in the U.S. strategy towards the Asia Pacific has brought enormous external pressures to bear on China,"" said a recent commentary by the Study Times paper, published by the Central Party School, which trains rising officials.It pointed in particular to U.S. efforts to bolster alliances with countries such as Japan and the Philippines.China is involved in bitter disputes over sea boundaries with both nations, as well as Vietnam, which has sought to strengthen ties with Washington.""Higher Chinese spending, coupled with increasingly aggressive actions and assertive language, is likely to further push countries into the U.S. nominal embrace,"" said Richard Bitzinger, a military analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.Many Asian countries are also getting out their chequebooks.Japan approved a record $42 billion military budget last month. India boosted defence spending by 12 percent for 2014-15 to $38.35 billion and military expenditure is seen rising to $40 billion in Southeast Asia in 2016.While Chinese leaders would be aware of the regional optics of announcing a big budget for the 2.3-million strong PLA at a time of lower projected fiscal revenue growth, diplomats said they believed Xi wants to also placate military leaders and ordinary soldiers feeling the heat from an anti-graft campaign.China's top military decision-making body, the Central Military Commission, which Xi chairs, has investigated several generals as part of a scandal into the selling of PLA positions.It has also targeted the second artillery corps, which controls China's nuclear missiles, as well as the navy and the air force.""It is inconceivable Xi could make cuts now given the enemies he's got internally,"" one Western diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.MONEY FOR ANTI-SUB SHIPS, DRONESDespite the massive sums spent over the past two decades, a recent report by the U.S.-based RAND Corp think tank said the PLA suffered from potentially serious weaknesses that could limit its ability to win future wars.The report, commissioned by a U.S. Congressional committee, said China faced shortcomings stemming from outdated command structures, quality of personnel and corruption, as well as weakness in combat capabilities such as anti-submarine warfare.Aware of some of these gaps, experts said the PLA would continue strengthening its naval presence in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea, a region dominated by the United States and its allies, and through which four-fifths of China's oil imports pass.""The navy is still seriously lagging behind in anti-submarine capabilities,"" said a military expert at a Chinese government think tank who declined to be identified.Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University, said he expected more funding for military drones and maritime surveillance aircraft.""Pro-defence spending actors within China can easily say China is expanding its global role to justify spending on submarines, amphibious ships and aircraft carriers,"" he said.(Additional reporting by Michael Martina and Ben Blanchard, and Greg Torode in HONG KONG; Editing by Dean Yates)"
116,Panda mania hits Germany as China's cuddly envoys arrive,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4634746/Panda-mania-hits-Germany-Chinas-cuddly-envoys-arrive.html," 04:19 BST, 24 June 2017 ","          The excitement at the welcome press conference gave the pandas a taste of what might be to come in their new home  Germany had its first taste of panda mania on Saturday as two furry ambassadors arrived from China to begin a new life as stars of Berlin's premier zoo. The pair, named Meng Meng and Jiao Qing, jetted in on a special Lufthansa cargo plane, accompanied by two Chinese panda specialists, the Berlin Zoo's chief vet and a tonne of bamboo. A crowd of journalists and officials on hand to welcome the VIPs let out an ""ooooh"" as Meng Meng raised a paw after flight LH8415 made an especially gentle touchdown at Schoenefeld airport. The black and white pair, clearly groggy after the 12 hour 20 minute flight from Chengdu in southern China, lay resting in their travelling crates during the welcome ceremony in a hangar. Until, that is, the Chinese ambassador to Berlin got a little too close, prompting Jiao Ling, the male, to stand up, roar and beat his paws against the plexiglass sides of the crate. ""From this evening, their German and Chinese handlers will stay with them... we'll do everything to help them calm down so they have a good night, eat well and rehydrate themselves,"" Berlin Zoo director Andreas Knieriem told AFP. After just over a week's acclimatisation, the pair will be unveiled to the public by no less than Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping, most likely two days before the G20 summit of world leaders hosted by Germany.          The pandas were flown in on a special cargo flight from China  Famed for its ""panda diplomacy"", China has dispatched its national treasure to only about a dozen countries as a symbol of close relations. Export giants Germany and China have nurtured increasingly close economic ties, and over the last year the have also taken on the leading role in championing free trade as Donald Trump shifts the US away from market liberalisation with his ""America First"" push. ""The Chinese see the pandas as Chinese brand ambassadors. China obviously has an image problem in Europe and giving pandas is a very smart and easy way to win hearts,"" said Bernhard Bartsch from the Bertelsmann Foundation think tank in Berlin. The ""pandas will lend a very positive spin in German media to the visit by Xi Jinping in July,"" he added. - Bamboo snacks, absorbent mats - The excitement over the two bears was clear as the zoo published a daily update on its blog in the run-up to their arrival. The flight to Germany was carefully prepared, with ""bamboo snacks"" to keep the pandas happy and absorbent mats to ensure the transport box stayed dry and odourless.          The Berlin Zoo built a special enclosure for the two pandas it is receiving from China just a few days before a G20 summit in Germany  And their new home at Berlin's zoo will measure about 5,500 square metres (59,000 square feet) and comes fitted with a wooded climbing area and an artificial stream. Meng Meng means ""dream"" in Chinese, while Jiao Qing translates as ""darling"", though the Chinese characters are a composite of ""tender"" and ""festive"" or ""celebration"". But the honour of hosting them does not come cheap. The zoo will pay $15 million (13.4 million euros) for a 15-year contract to host them, with most of the money going towards a conservation and breeding research programme in China. And the pandas' main dish -- bamboo -- will cost tens of thousands of euros each year. The zoo will probably look to offset part of its outlays through panda-themed merchandising. Ultimately, it hopes that the pair will produce babies, even if experts have warned that panda reproduction is a fine art. Panda expert Jerome Pouille said that ""the female is only receptive to a male for about 24 to 48 hours a year"", adding that there was little chance of a cub within the first three years. China has previously given three pandas to Germany, but the last one, 34-year-old Bao Bao, died in Berlin in 2012, having become the oldest male panda in the world. About 1,864 pandas remain in the wild in China, up from around 1,000 in the late 1970s, according to the environmental group WWF. Just over 400 pandas live in zoos around the world, in conservation projects set up with Beijing."

White House officials said Tuesday that trade and security would be high on the new American president's agenda, including pushing China to exert more economic pressure on North Korea.Speaking at a White House business forum Tuesday, Trump called North Korea a ""humanity problem."" A White House official later said ""all options are on the table"" for the U.S., though the official would not say what steps Trump was willing to take to curb Pyongyang's pursuit of a nuclear weapon.

President Donald Trump's upcoming summit with China's leader will be closely watched for signs of how relations between the world's top two economies will proceed as they tackle weighty questions over trade, North Korea and the South China Sea. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the waters off its east coast on Wednesday, U.S. and South Korean officials said, in a reminder of the simmering tensions on the Korean peninsula.Like many nations, China is still grappling with Trump's mercurial nature after the relative transparency and predictability of the bilateral relationship under Barack Obama. Both during his campaign and after his victory, Trump complained repeatedly over China's allegedly unfair trade practices, its perceived lack of assistance in reining in North Korea and its drive to cement control over the South China Sea.Some analysts believe Xi might be willing to hand Trump a symbolic victory on trade to put a positive spin on the meeting.""Xi probably can't accommodate Trump on sovereignty and security issues, but he has a lot of leeway on economics,"" said Robert Sutter, a China expert at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.Yet even if Xi is able to offer Trump deliverables, he will still have to deal with ""a restless U.S. president valuing unpredictability and seeking advantage for his agenda going forward,"" Sutter said.Trump was seen as moving trade even more to the forefront when he signed a pair of executive orders Friday focused on reducing the trade deficit. Coupled together, the orders appeared to be a symbolic shot at China, which accounted for the vast bulk - $347 billion - of last year's $502 billion trade deficit.While aides insisted the timing was coincidental, the administration touted the moves as evidence of it taking an aggressive but analytical approach to closing a trade gap that is largely due to the influx of goods from China.Still, Trump told the Financial Times newspaper that during his meeting with Xi, he doesn't ""want to talk about tariffs yet, perhaps the next time we meet."" A second White House official said Tuesday that the topic may come up, though there was not expected to be any resolution.The officials would only discuss the upcoming summit on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid pre-empting the president.Looming over the visit will be North Korea's nuclear provocations. China continues to oppose the tough measures demanded of it to address the issue, fearing a collapse of the Pyongyang regime would bring a crush of refugees and possibly U.S. and South Korean troops on its border.Trump told the Financial Times the U.S. is prepared to act alone if China does not take a tougher stand against North Korea's nuclear program.""China has great influence over North Korea,"" Trump said. ""And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won't. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don't it won't be good for anyone.""Add to the mix the issue of the South China Sea, where China has built and armed man-made islands despite the concerns of neighboring countries; and Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that China claims as its own territory, and that some in Trump's administration would like to build a stronger relationship with.Despite such divisions, Beijing seems committed to establishing a positive relationship between the two leaders.""It is fundamental for them to improve understanding between each other,"" said Xiong Zhiyong, a professor at Peking University's School of International Relations. ""Both sides have shown their willingness to cooperate and they are expected to make a commitment for cooperation.""China, Xiong said, realizes that Trump ""is a leader with a strong personality.""The White House said Trump and Xi would hold meetings and a dinner on Thursday, then gather again Friday for more discussions and a working lunch. First lady Melania Trump and Xi's wife, famed songstress Peng Liyuan, plan to attend the dinner.As personalities, Xi and Trump are a study in contrasts. A lifelong Communist Party apparatchik and son of a former vice premier, Xi has built his career with a cautious approach, avoiding controversial reforms and rarely speaking out in ways that would distract from his core message. His nearly five years as head of the ruling party have been defined by a campaign to achieve the ""Chinese dream"" of increasing prosperity while tackling endemic corruption.Still, outwardly cordial relations with U.S. presidents are also a longstanding Chinese tradition, in recognition of the importance of the relationship. Xi had taken pains to appear at ease in the company of Obama, avoiding the rancor that characterized the relationship between the American leader and Russian President Vladimir Putin.___Bodeen reported from Beijing.

But a better comparison might be with the style and powers of the American president.He wields enormous personal power, in contrast to the more collective leadership style of Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, has assumed an unprecedented profile abroad as the country's chief diplomat and has been heavily promoted at home as the responsible face of the party and the government.Xi is regularly portrayed in the domestic media carrying out ceremonial functions, inspecting military parades, welcoming foreign dignitaries, and demanding explanations from lower level officials in the event of disasters and political controversies such as the stampede in Shanghai at New Year, all the sorts of things that a U.S. president does.Xi's image-makers show the same obsession with controlling perceptions of the leader as the West Wing staff of President Barack Obama, presenting him as a strong, dynamic, well-informed and singular leader who takes responsibility for all decisions carried out by the party and the government in his name.""He is the first leader to employ a big team to build his public profile. But he also has a flair for it - thanks to his stature, his toughness and his common touch,"" the Economist magazine noted last year (""Xi who must be obeyed"" Sept. 20, 2014).Xi has also cultivated a distinctly presidential approach abroad. In 2014, Xi and Premier Li Keqiang - the number two in the Chinese hierarchy who combines the functions of vice-president, secretary of state and secretary of the treasury - spent a total of 85 days on high-profile visits to 30 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Oceania.Xinhua, the official news agency, likened this flurry of top-level summits and meetings to a ""Chinese whirlwind"" (""China's active diplomatic posture wins global applause"" Dec. 28, 2014).Putting top leaders on the international diplomatic circuit so much is no accident.

The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has started to send warships on port calls around the world.In 2014, the PLAN paid its first port call to Bandar Abbas in Iran, the first time its warships have entered the Middle East Gulf.

Xi has developed something similar with his ""Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road"" (""China's initiatives on building Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road,"" Xinhua, undated).Just as the United States has used free trade agreements, military assistance, aid and lending by policy banks to reward allies and deepen diplomatic relationships, China's leaders have been busy doling out trade deals as well as billions of dollars of loans and investments to selected strategic partners in the hope of winning greater influence and support.President Xi and China's diplomatic corps seem to be consciously copying the American model of international relations, adapted to meet their own strategic priorities and resources, seeking to put China at the heart of a web of diplomatic, economic and military influence equal but different to the United States.XI WHO MUST BE OBEYEDAt home, too, China's top leader appears to have learned important lessons from the United States about the importance of very visible and singular presidential leadership.Xi has become adept at using the presidential bully pulpit to advocate a clear policy direction and agenda in a manner that would be instantly recognisable to U.S. presidents from Theodore Roosevelt (who coined the phrase) to Ronald Reagan.Even the anti-corruption campaign and the president's repeated focus on strengthening the rule of law are clearly designed to centralise political and administrative control as well as remove rivals and rebuild the party's legitimacy.Reducing corruption and strengthening the rule of law are not about making the political system more participative, let alone democratic. They are primarily focused on making the party-government system more effective, efficient and stable.In many instances during the Hu and Jiang years state enterprises, provinces and local administrations ignored directives from the top leadership with impunity.

119,China sidesteps blame over S. Korean journalist's beating,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5182029/S-Korea-outraged-journalist-beating-China.html," 05:30 BST, 15 December 2017 ","          South Korean President Moon Jae-In (L) is on a four-day state visit to China, hosted by President Xi Jinping  China sidestepped blame Friday for the beating of a South Korean photojournalist by Chinese security, an incident that has marred a visit by the South Korean president to mend frayed ties with Beijing. The incident has sparked outrage in South Korea, with the opposition calling on Moon to cancel the rest of his four-day state visit, his first in China since taking office in May. A photographer was thrown to the floor and kicked, reportedly suffering fractured facial bones and ruptured vessels in an eye, as Chinese security personnel stopped South Korean photographers following Moon's delegation at a trade show on Thursday. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang expressed ""concern"" that someone had been hurt and said an investigation was ongoing. Officials from both countries have discussed the issue and ""we hope we can get the facts straight as soon as possible,"" he said. But, he added: ""This event was organised by the South Korean side, the journalists involved were invited by the South Korean side, and the security guards were also recruited and hired by the Korean side."" The South Korean organisers should have ""found an equilibrium"" between the journalists' desire for more time with and proximity to the president, and the guards' ""professional requirements... (to) sufficiently guarantee the safety and dignity of the people they protect,"" he said. They should have ""from the very beginning made clear what rights the media have"" as well as ""how much leeway and space to manoeuver"" the guards had to deal with emergencies, he added. - 'Warmth of springtime' - Relations between Beijing and Seoul soured after South Korea allowed the United States to install the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system to guard against threats from North Korea. China considers THAAD a threat to its own security, and has imposed economic measures against South Korean companies in a move seen as retaliation. Moon and President Xi Jinping both indicated their willingness to reset relations when they held talks on Thursday -- a message that was repeated in the South Korean leader's meeting on Friday with Premier Li Keqiang. Moon said he hoped that ""the recovery and development of China and South Korean relations can happen as quickly as the frequency of our meetings"", noting that he had met Li for the first time just a month before. Li also heralded the thaw, saying ""both sides are looking forward to the warmth of the springtime."" But South Korean newspapers reported that Moon had his first three meals in China without any Chinese officials on hand, with an earlier lunch with Li unilaterally scrapped. He was greeted by an assistant minister when he landed, while Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was welcomed last year by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. - 'Mistreatment' and 'lynching' - While Moon courted Chinese leaders, South Korean media, opposition parties and internet users voiced outrage over the reporter's beating, many saying the incident epitomised the Asian giant's attitude towards its smaller neighbour. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party urged Moon to return home immediately, saying the violence was a ""terror attack against the whole of South Korea"". ""Mistreatment of President Moon and lynching of a Korean journalist - This is the Chinese Dream"", the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's largest-circulation daily, headlined its editorial, referring to Xi's promise of prosperity and influence. Chosun said the perceived diplomatic slight and the violence against a member of Moon's presidential press corps were ""not accidental"" and were driven by ""China's arrogant and violent nature"" and ""Seoul's subservient attitude"". The English-language Korea Times called it ""an appalling use of force by Chinese security"". ""We are dumbfounded and enraged at such violence against visitors.... We are outraged by the rude welcome"", it said. Internet users also reacted angrily. ""China trampled upon Korea and the whole Korean people,"" one said in a posting."

But a better comparison might be with the style and powers of the American president.He wields enormous personal power, in contrast to the more collective leadership style of Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, has assumed an unprecedented profile abroad as the country's chief diplomat and has been heavily promoted at home as the responsible face of the party and the government.Xi is regularly portrayed in the domestic media carrying out ceremonial functions, inspecting military parades, welcoming foreign dignitaries, and demanding explanations from lower level officials in the event of disasters and political controversies such as the stampede in Shanghai at New Year, all the sorts of things that a U.S. president does.Xi's image-makers show the same obsession with controlling perceptions of the leader as the West Wing staff of President Barack Obama, presenting him as a strong, dynamic, well-informed and singular leader who takes responsibility for all decisions carried out by the party and the government in his name.""He is the first leader to employ a big team to build his public profile. But he also has a flair for it - thanks to his stature, his toughness and his common touch,"" the Economist magazine noted last year (""Xi who must be obeyed"" Sept. 20, 2014).Xi has also cultivated a distinctly presidential approach abroad.

121,China's mass indoctrination camps evoke Cultural Revolution,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5739977/Survivors-Chinas-far-west-political-camps-ordeal.html," 11:19 BST, 17 May 2018 "," ALMATY, Kazakhstan (AP) - Hour upon hour, day upon day, Omir Bekali and other detainees in far western China's new indoctrination camps had to disavow their Islamic beliefs, criticize themselves and their loved ones and give thanks to the ruling Communist Party. When Bekali, a Kazakh Muslim, refused to follow orders each day, he was forced to stand at a wall for five hours at a time. A week later, he was sent to solitary confinement, where he was deprived of food for 24 hours. After 20 days in the heavily guarded camp, he wanted to kill himself. ""The psychological pressure is enormous, when you have to criticize yourself, denounce your thinking - your own ethnic group,"" said Bekali, who broke down in tears as he described the camp. ""I still think about it every night, until the sun rises. I can't sleep. The thoughts are with me all the time.""          In this March 29, 2018, photo, Omir Bekali cries as he details the psychological stress endured while in a Chinese internment camp during an interview in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Since 2016, Chinese authorities in the heavily Muslim region of Xinjiang have ensnared tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of Muslim Chinese, and even foreign citizens, in mass internment camps. The program aims to rewire detainees' thinking and reshape their identities. Chinese officials say ideological changes are needed to fight Islamic extremism. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)  Since last spring, Chinese authorities in the heavily Muslim region of Xinjiang have ensnared tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of Muslim Chinese - and even foreign citizens - in mass internment camps. This detention campaign has swept across Xinjiang, a territory half the area of India, leading to what a U.S. commission on China last month said is ""the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today."" Chinese officials have largely avoided comment on the camps, but some are quoted in state media as saying that ideological changes are needed to fight separatism and Islamic extremism. Radical Muslim Uighurs have killed hundreds in recent years, and China considers the region a threat to peace in a country where the majority is Han Chinese. The internment program aims to rewire the political thinking of detainees, erase their Islamic beliefs and reshape their very identities. The camps have expanded rapidly over the past year, with almost no judicial process or legal paperwork. Detainees who most vigorously criticize the people and things they love are rewarded, and those who refuse to do so are punished with solitary confinement, beatings and food deprivation. The recollections of Bekali, a heavyset and quiet 42-year-old, offer what appears to be the most detailed account yet of life inside so-called re-education camps. The Associated Press also conducted rare interviews with three other former internees and a former instructor in other centers who corroborated Bekali's depiction. Most spoke on condition of anonymity to protect their families in China. Bekali's case stands out because he was a foreign citizen, of Kazakhstan, who was seized by China's security agencies and detained for eight months last year without recourse. Although some details are impossible to verify, two Kazakh diplomats confirmed he was held for seven months and then sent to re-education. The detention program is a hallmark of China's emboldened state security apparatus under the deeply nationalistic, hard-line rule of President Xi Jinping. It is partly rooted in the ancient Chinese belief in transformation through education - taken once before to terrifying extremes during the mass thought reform campaigns of Mao Zedong, the Chinese leader sometimes channeled by Xi. ""Cultural cleansing is Beijing's attempt to find a final solution to the Xinjiang problem,"" said James Millward, a China historian at Georgetown University. Rian Thum, a professor at Loyola University in New Orleans, said China's re-education system echoes some of the worst human rights violations in history. ""The closest analogue is maybe the Cultural Revolution in that this will leave long-term, psychological effects,"" Thum said. ""This will create a multigenerational trauma from which many people will never recover."" Asked to comment on the camps, China's Foreign Ministry said it ""had not heard"" of the situation. When asked why non-Chinese had been detained, it said the Chinese government protects the rights of foreigners in China and they should also be law-abiding. Chinese officials in Xinjiang did not respond to requests for comment. However, bits and pieces from state media and journals show the confidence Xinjiang officials hold in methods that they say work well to curb religious extremism. China's top prosecutor, Zhang Jun, urged Xinjiang's authorities this month to extensively expand what the government calls the ""transformation through education"" drive in an ""all-out effort"" to fight separatism and extremism. In a June 2017 paper published by a state-run journal, a researcher from Xinjiang's Communist Party School reported that most of 588 surveyed participants did not know what they had done wrong when they were sent to re-education. But by the time they were released, nearly all - 98.8 percent- had learned their mistakes, the paper said. Transformation through education, the researcher concluded, ""is a permanent cure."" ___ ""PEOPLE'S WAR ON TERROR"" On the chilly morning of March 23, 2017, Bekali drove up to the Chinese border from his home in Almaty, Kazakhstan, got a stamp in his Kazakh passport and crossed over for a work trip, not quite grasping the extraordinary circumstances he was stepping into. Bekali was born in China in 1976 to Kazakh and Uighur parents, moved to Kazakhstan in 2006 and received citizenship three years later. He was out of China in 2016, when authorities sharply escalated a ""People's War on Terror"" to root out what the government called religious extremism and separatism in Xinjiang, a large Chinese territory bordering Pakistan and several Central Asian states, including Kazakhstan. The Xinjiang he returned to was unrecognizable. All-encompassing, data-driven surveillance tracked residents in a region with around 12 million Muslims, including ethnic Uighurs and Kazakhs. Viewing a foreign website, taking phone calls from relatives abroad, praying regularly or growing a beard could land one in a political indoctrination camp, or prison, or both. The new internment system was shrouded in secrecy, with no publicly available data on the numbers of camps or detainees. The U.S. State Department estimates those being held are ""at the very least in the tens of thousands."" A Turkey-based TV station run by Xinjiang exiles said almost 900,000 were detained, citing leaked government documents. Adrian Zenz, a researcher at the European School of Culture and Theology, puts the number between several hundreds of thousands and just over 1 million. Government bids and recruitment ads studied by Zenz suggest that the camps have cost more than $100 million since 2016, and construction is ongoing. Bekali knew none of this when he visited his parents on March 25. He passed police checkpoints and handed over his decade-old Chinese identity card. The next day, five armed policemen showed up at Bekali's parents' doorstep and took him away. They said there was a warrant for his arrest in Karamay, a frontier oil town where he lived a decade earlier. He couldn't call his parents or a lawyer, the police added, because his case was ""special."" Bekali was held in a cell, incommunicado, for a week, and then was driven 500 miles (804 kilometers) to Karamay's Baijiantan District public security office. There, they strapped him into a ""tiger chair,"" a device that clamped down his wrists and ankles. They also hung him by his wrists against a barred wall, just high enough so he would feel excruciating pressure in his shoulder unless he stood on the balls of his bare feet. They interrogated him about his work with a tourist agency inviting Chinese to apply for Kazakh tourist visas, which they claimed was a way to help Chinese Muslims escape. ""I haven't committed any crimes!"" Bekali yelled. They asked for days what he knew about two dozen prominent ethnic Uighur activists and businessmen in Kazakhstan. Exhausted and aching, Bekali coughed up what he knew about a few names he recognized. The police then sent Bekali to a 10- by 10-meter (32- by 32-foot) cell in the prison with 17 others, their feet chained to the posts of two large beds. Some wore dark blue uniforms, while others wore orange for political crimes. Bekali was given orange. In mid-July, three months after his arrest, Bekali received a visit from Kazakh diplomats. China's mass detention of ethnic Kazakhs - and even Kazakh citizens - has begun to make waves in the Central Asian country of 18 million. Kazakh officials say China detained 10 Kazakh citizens and hundreds of ethnic Kazakh Chinese in Xinjiang over the past year, though they were released in late April following a visit by a Kazakh deputy foreign minister. Four months after the visit, Bekali was taken out of his cell and handed a release paper. But he was not yet free. ___ ""WE NOW KNOW BETTER"" Bekali was driven from jail to a fenced compound in the northern suburbs of Karamay, where three buildings held more than 1,000 internees receiving political indoctrination, he said. He walked in, past a central station that could see over the entire facility, and received a tracksuit. Heavily armed guards watched over the compound from a second level. He joined a cell with 40 internees, he said, including teachers, doctors and students. Men and women were separated. Internees would wake up together before dawn, sing the Chinese national anthem, and raise the Chinese flag at 7:30 a.m. They gathered back inside large classrooms to learn ""red songs"" like ""Without the Communist Party, there is no New China,"" and study Chinese language and history. They were told that the indigenous sheep-herding Central Asian people of Xinjiang were backward and yoked by slavery before they were ""liberated"" by the Communist Party in the 1950s. Before meals of vegetable soup and buns, the inmates would be ordered to chant: ""Thank the Party! Thank the Motherland! Thank President Xi!"" Discipline was strictly enforced and punishment could be harsh. Bekali was kept in a locked room almost around the clock with eight other internees, who shared beds and a wretched toilet. Cameras were installed in toilets and even outhouses. Baths were rare, as was washing of hands and feet, which internees were told was equated with Islamic ablution. Bekali and other former internees say the worst parts of the indoctrination program were forced repetition and self-criticism. Although students didn't understand much of what was taught and the material bordered on the nonsensical to them, they were made to internalize it by repetition in sessions lasting two hours or longer. ""We will oppose extremism, we will oppose separatism, we will oppose terrorism,"" they chanted again and again. Almost every day, the students received guest lecturers from the local police, judiciary and other branches of government warning about the dangers of separatism and extremism. In four-hour sessions, instructors lectured about the dangers of Islam and drilled internees with quizzes that they had to answer correctly or be sent to stand near a wall for hours on end. ""Do you obey Chinese law or Sharia?"" instructors asked. ""Do you understand why religion is dangerous?"" One by one, internees would stand up before 60 of their classmates to present self-criticisms of their religious history, Bekali said. The detainees would also have to criticize and be criticized by their peers. Those who parroted official lines particularly well or lashed into their fellow internees viciously were awarded points and could be transferred to more comfortable surroundings in other buildings, he said. ""I was taught the Holy Quran by my father and I learned it because I didn't know better,"" Bekali heard one say. ""I traveled outside China without knowing that I could be exposed to extremist thoughts abroad,"" Bekali recalled another saying. ""Now I know."" A Uighur woman told AP she was held in a center in the city of Hotan in 2016. She said she and fellow prisoners repeatedly were forced to apologize for wearing long clothes in Muslim style, praying, teaching the Quran to their children and asking imams to name their children. Praying at a mosque on any day other than Friday was a sign of extremism; so was attending Friday prayers outside their village or having Quranic verses or graphics on their phones. While instructors watched, those who confessed to such behavior were told to repeat over and over: ""We have done illegal things, but we now know better."" ___ OWING THE COUNTRY Other detainees and a re-education camp instructor tell similar stories. In mid-2017, a Uighur former on-air reporter for Xinjiang TV known as Eldost was recruited to teach Chinese history and culture in an indoctrination camp because he spoke excellent Mandarin. He had no choice. The re-education system, Eldost said, classified internees into three levels of security and duration of sentences. The first group typically consisted of illiterate minority farmers who didn't commit any ostensible crimes other than not speaking Chinese. The second class was made up of people who were caught at home or on their smartphones with religious content or so-called separatist materials, such as lectures by the Uighur intellectual Ilham Tohti. The final group was made up of those who had studied religion abroad and came back, or were seen to be affiliated with foreign elements. In the latter cases, internees were often were sentenced to prison terms of 10 to 15 years, Eldost said. While he was teaching, Eldost once saw through the window 20 students driven into the courtyard. Two rows of guards waited for them and beat them as soon as they got out of the police van. He later heard that the internees were recent arrivals who had studied religion in the Middle East. Violence was not regularly dispensed, but every internee AP spoke to saw at least one incident of rough treatment or beatings. Eldost said the instruction was aimed at showing how backward traditional Uighur culture is and how repressive fundamentalist Islam is compared to a progressive Communist Party. The internees' confessions of their backwardness helped drive the point home. ""Internees are told to repeat those confessions to the point where, when they are finally freed, they believe that they owe the country a lot, that they could never repay the party,"" said Eldost, who escaped from China in August after paying a bribe. Eldost said he tried in little ways to help his internees. Tasked with teaching the Three Character Classic, a Confucian standard taught widely in elementary schools, he would make up mnemonic devices to help his students - including elderly or illiterate Uighur farmers who barely knew their own language - recite a few lines. He also advised students to stop habitually saying ""praise God"" in Arabic and Uighur because other instructors punished them for it. Every time he went to sleep in a room with 80 others, he said, the last thing he would hear was the sound of misery. ""I heard people crying every night,"" he said. ""That was the saddest experience in my life."" Another former detainee, a Uighur from Hotan in southern Xinjiang, said his newly built center had just 90 people in two classes in 2015. There, a government instructor claimed said that Uighur women historically did not wear underwear, braided their hair to signal their sexual availability, and had dozens of sexual partners. ""It made me so angry,"" the detainee said. ""These kinds of explanations of Uighur women humiliated me. I still remember this story every time I think about this, I feel like a knife cut a hole in my chest."" Kayrat Samarkan, a Chinese Kazakh from Astana who was detained while running errands in a northern Xinjiang police station in December, was sent to an internment camp in Karamagay in northern Xinjiang with 5,700 students. Those who didn't obey, were late to class or got into fights were put for 12 hours in a loose body-suit that was made of iron and limited their movement, he said. Those who still disobeyed would be locked in a tiger chair for 24 hours. As one form of punishment, he said, instructors would press an internee's head in a tub of ice and water. After three months, Samarkan couldn't take the lessons anymore, so he bashed his head against a wall to try to kill himself. He merely fell unconscious. ""When I woke up, the staff threatened me, saying if I did that again they would extend my sentence to 7 years there,"" he said. After 20 days, Bekali also contemplated suicide. Several days later, because of his intransigence and refusal to speak Mandarin, Bekali was no longer permitted to go into the courtyard. Instead, he was sent to a higher level of management, where he spent 24 hours a day in a room with 8 others. A week later, he went to his first stint in solitary confinement. He saw a local judicial official walking into the building on an inspection tour and yelled at the top of his lungs. He thought even his former detention center, with the abuse he suffered, would be better. ""Take me in the back and kill me, or send me back to prison,"" he shouted. ""I can't be here anymore."" He was again hauled off to solitary confinement. It lasted 24 hours, ending late afternoon on Nov. 24. That's when Bekali was released, as suddenly as he was detained eight months earlier. A Baijiantan policemen who had always gone easy on Bekali during interrogation appeared and checked him out of the facility. ""You were too headstrong, but what the department did was unjust,"" he told Bekali as he drove him to his sister's home in Karamay. Bekali was free. ___ FREEDOM, BUT NOT FOR HIS FAMILY The next morning, a Saturday, the police opened their immigration office for Bekali to pick up a unique, 14-day Chinese visa. His original had long expired. Bekali left China on December 4. Seeking compensation from the Chinese government is out of the question. But Bekali keeps a plastic folder at home of evidence that might prove useful someday: his passport with stamps and visas, travel records and a handwritten Chinese police document dated and imprinted with red-ink seals. The document is the closest thing he has to an official acknowledgement that he suffered for eight months. It says he was held on suspicion of endangering national security; the last sentence declares him released without charge. At first, Bekali did not want the AP to publish his account for fear that his sister and mother in China would be detained and sent to re-education. But on March 10, back in China, the police took his sister, Adila Bekali. A week later, on March 19, they took his mother, Amina Sadik. And on April 24, his father, Ebrayem. Bekali changed his mind and said he wanted to tell his story, no matter the consequences. ""Things have already come this far,"" he said.

122,Berlin rolls out red carpet as giant pandas arrive from China,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4635762/Berlin-rolls-red-carpet-giant-pandas-arrive-China.html," 17:05 BST, 24 June 2017 "," Two giant pandas have received a celebrity welcome in Berlin from the mayor and Chinese ambassador after they weathered a long flight from China. Meng Meng and Jiao Qing flew the animal equivalent of first class on their 12-hour flight from Chengdu in south-west China to the German capital. Their entourage included a Berlin vet, two Chinese zookeepers and a group of journalists.          A container carrying the giant panda Jiao Qing is unloaded from a cargo plane (Markus Schreiber/AP)  “They slept a bit, munched on their bamboo and nibbled on some cookies,” vet Andreas Ochs said at Berlin’s Schoenefeld airport. Medication for motion sickness was not needed. “They did just fine,” he said. The German capital is going wild over the impossibly cute bears, who will be presented to the public at Berlin Zoo on July 6.          Giant panda Meng Meng looks out of its container (Markus Schreiber/AP)  Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese president Xi Jinping are also expected to visit the new animal stars ahead of the G20 summit in Germany in early July. “It was my personal wish to come and welcome our new residents,” Mayor Michael Mueller said. “We are delighted that Berlin has gained another fantastic attraction with these bears.” Jiao Qing, which means “darling”, is a seven-year-old male and weighs 108kg. Female Meng Meng, which translates as “sweet dream”, is three years old and weighs 77kg. The pandas were taken from the airport to the zoo with police protection so they did not have to stop at any red lights.          Giant panda Jiao Qing (Markus Schreiber/AP)  They also brought their own food on the plane – one metric ton of bamboo from China. Once they have chewed up all of that, the zoo will start importing special bamboo from the Netherlands. The furry couple will move into a ritzy new nine million euro (£8 million) compound, complete with Chinese-style pavilions, red lanterns, a climbing area and a mountain landscape. They will be the only pandas in the country, the German news agency dpa reported. Expectations are high the two will reproduce soon, though Mr Ochs warned that Meng Meng is not mature enough yet.          Giant pandas Meng Meng, right and Jiao Qing look out of the transport containers (Markus Schreiber/AP)  The arrival of the black-and-white bears was preceded by years of bilateral negotiations, since giant pandas are unique to China and sent abroad as diplomatic envoys. “In China, pandas are regarded as a national treasure,” Chinese ambassador Shi Mingde said. “Therefore the breeding and conservation of these animals is a top priority for us.” The pandas will be on loan from China for 15 years – a deal for which it is charging a million euro (£880,000) each year, dpa reported. Berlin’s last panda, Bao Bao, was sent in 1980 as a gift from then-Chinese leader Hua Guofeng to West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Bao Bao died in 2012. Berlin’s most famous zoo animal, the polar bear Knut, died of a sudden illness in 2011."

It would also more than double the number of specialized academies to 20,000.

Seeking to close a glaring gap in its international sporting prowess, China has announced an ambitious football development plan that envisions 50 million players joining in the game by the end of the decade and the development of the country into a ""first-rate major footballing power"" by the middle of the century. (AP Photo/File) CHINA OUT The plan is to be rolled out in three stages, with the short term goals set for 2020, midterm for 2030 and long-term for 2050. No figures were given on how much the government plans to spend on the project.The aim, the document says, is to ""strive to realize the goal of becoming a first-rate major footballing power, realize the all-around development of Chinese football, fulfill the football dream of the sons and daughters of China, and fulfill our obligations to world football.""Despite its success in other sports at the Olympics and other global competitions, China has been a perennial underperformer in international football. Its men's team has qualified for only one World Cup finals competition, in 2002, and is given poor odds of making it to Russia in 2018.A recent $300 million splurge to bring big-name foreign talent to the Chinese Premier League has raised the level of play among top-flight domestic clubs. It's far from clear though, whether their skills will rub-off on local talent. Of the 16 goals scored in the league's opening round, not one could be attributed to a homegrown Chinese player and the influx of overseas goal-scoring talent could further reduce local players' chances to shine.Despite that, President Xi Jinping has made boosting Chinese football's fortunes a top sporting priority, ordering the cabinet to help guide the plan announced Monday and demanding results.As befits a document produced by a Communist Party-led government accustomed to dictating top-down solutions, the plan comes laden with political jargon and patriotic exhortations.Football ""is an important vessel of the national spirit. Football has an important education function that benefits the propagation of socialist core values,"" the document said.Despite the government's encouragement, analysts questioned whether parents would be willing to allow what is often their only child to spend more time on sports programs that take time away from their studies. While football is hugely popular in China, participation in the sport is not as deeply embedded in the culture as in European nations, they said.""It is very hard to buy such success in a team sport, not only football, because such sports are deeply anchored in popular culture and have everything to do with little kids playing them from when they start to walk,"" wrote Andrei Markovits, a professor of comparative politics at the University of Michigan and author of ""Gaming the World: How Sports Are Reshaping Global Politics and Culture.""""In other words, one cannot 'plan' these things from above like one can individual sports,"" Markovits wrote in a comment on the Chinese football plan.

A reorganised poll is expected early next year.Chinese football has made huge strides in recent years owing to the rise of its domestic league, whose lavishly financed clubs are attracting top players and managers.Chinese Super League clubs have spent just over 400 million euros ($447 million) on players this year, luring stars like Liverpool target Alex Teixeira.Zhang said the Chinese Super League now wanted to reach the level of the top divisions of Europe, which remain the world's leading football competitions.""We have attracted a lot of players to the Chinese Super League and companies have invested so much money,"" said Zhang.""It's a good thing for us but we should be professional and try to be a better league and catch up with the higher levels of European leagues,"" he added.Zhang was also confident that China's growing legion of foreign players would help the national team, rather than hinder the development of home-grown talent.""China's national team is a problem.

But while Beijing campaigns against what it calls online misinformation, erasing critical online comments and arresting dozens of bloggers over the past 18 months, the Communist Party has embraced Zhou.

Zhou said in his blog that Xi told him to keep spreading ""positive energy on the Internet.""China's stodgy state-run media often fall flat as they try to portray the West in an unflattering light, but Zhou's approach has been more successful: His microblog has more than 500,000 followers, and party websites and newspapers have carried his articles. He deftly uses trendy online slang, including calling his readers ""dear"" with an abbreviated version of the Chinese phrase.But his posts have drawn criticism from skeptics who say he distorts and misleads, raising the risk that official efforts to glorify him may backfire.""People like Zhou play a role in helping the regime in guiding public opinion,"" said Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago. ""But he is so unconvincing that it has reflected badly on the regime.""Low-end cars in the U.S. cost less than half what Zhou contends. His claims about car insurance are even more exaggerated. And about 80 percent of American public school students graduate high school — not less than 50 percent.Fang Shimin, a well-known Chinese debunker, wrote an article that refutes some of Zhou's claims about America point by point. But it was quickly scrubbed from the Chinese Internet, and Fang's own blog and microblog accounts were shut down.Chinese propaganda officials have argued that it is important to safeguard Zhou's free speech despite the criticism.""Even though there are many blemishes in Zhou Xiaoping's articles, it is a harbinger for free speech when he can speak up,"" a statement posted on a government website run by the party's central propaganda department and its central office for building and guiding spiritual civilization. ""We can always analyze and debate whether the viewpoints are correct or not.""Tight censorship in China constantly scrubs criticism of the Communist Party-run government from the Internet and silences dissenting voices. The party seeks to control the remaining online message, a daunting task when the country's 1.3 billion people are increasingly connected to the rest of the world.Wary the public will look to the West for possible social changes, state-run media outlets have made a staple of articles exposing the shortcomings of Western societies, but they often fail to gain traction because of stiff language and the media's general lack of credibility among the public.Last year, the party-run People's Daily introduced the ""Dishonest Americans"" series, with stories including a New York City locksmith who demanded $800 for changing two locks. Many readers sneered at the series as unfair and discriminatory.Favorable postings about the United States often get circulated more widely on China's Internet and in its social media, with some articles going overboard in praising America and its social and political system. For example, several widely viewed posts in China suggest that health care in the U.S. is affordable to everyone.Then came Zhou, who said in his blogs that he needed to awaken his fellow Chinese ""hypnotized by social media and corrupted by magazines, newspapers and best-sellers.""Zhou did not respond to a request for an interview.Born into a poor family in Sichuan province, Zhou has written that after time in the military and other jobs, he became an entrepreneur involved in publishing and production of cultural exhibitions. He said his income increased ten-fold and that he joined the ""many, many Chinese people like me who have benefited from China's rapid economic development.""Fending off criticism that Chinese officials are corrupt, Zhou wrote that ""the U.S. is by no means a paradise"" and cited an unfounded allegation that a former U.S. ambassador to China chartered planes to engage in womanizing.He implied there was corruption in the White House by saying that the Obama family once spent $4 million on a single meal. The figure apparently comes from news reports that Obama family vacations in Hawaii cost about $4 million each time, largely because of the use of the Air Force One plane in which the first family travels.Zhou extols China's achievements while saying its political and social ills have been blown out of proportion. Zhou calls America a black hand in spreading rumors to disparage China's political system, dismantle public trust in the government and make the Chinese people feel deprived.Zhou's ""criticism against the West is always nitpicking, and the praise for China is always that small blemishes do not take away its beauty and virtue,"" independent writer Zhang Wen wrote in an article published on a news site by the Hong Kong-based Oriental Press Group Ltd. ""The facts and figures used for arguments are often inflated or partial, and some are sheer rubbish.""Zhang said Beijing chooses to overlook Zhou's misinformation because his blog can help persuade more people to side with the government and oppose the West. He added that it appears to be working.""One reason is that many readers are not in a position to judge, and another is that the strong nationalist tone in Zhou's articles has appealed to many ordinary Chinese,"" Zhang said."

A man makes an offering in front of a statue of the Yellow Emperor, or Huangdi, after a memorial ceremony in Xinzheng, in China's Henan province ©Greg Baker (AFP) Shots from gold-painted cannon began the annual ceremony, and the crowd, many in replica antique costume, listened to a booming announcer heralding the ""ancestor of the Chinese nation"".High-ranking cadres –- including the province's top official, and a former vice culture minister -– processed up a red carpet, placed offerings in front of an altar and gazed into the statue's chiselled visage, before bowing.Lydia Zhou, an investment manager who flew from Shanghai to attend, told AFP: ""I'm here to worship. He is our ancestor and this is his birthplace.""The lauding of an individual comes as Communist chief Xi Jinping is increasingly lionised in China's state-run media, and the announcer echoed his slogans: ""Revive China, a one hundred year dream, ruling by law, moderate prosperity for all.""- Mixed up -Historians say there is little evidence the Yellow Emperor actually existed, but school textbooks widely describe him as the founder of Chinese culture and ancestor of all Chinese people –- including its 55 official ethnic minorities, some of whom chafe against identifying as Chinese.The same books assert China has existed for 5,000 years since his birth, though historians date the first Chinese dynasty -- covering a tiny fraction of the present country -- to around 1600 BC.The Communist Party attempted to outlaw religion after taking power in 1949.Under Mao Zedong, ""Yellow Emperor worship was seen as feudal superstition,"" Ren Dahuan, vice president of a state-run research association into the figure, told AFP.But now the party says religion can be harnessed for social good ahead of it eventually melting away with economic progress.Searching for tourist and investment income, officials in the emperor's supposed birthplace of Xinzheng revived offerings in the 1990s. The ceremony was endorsed by the State Council, China's cabinet, in 2008.- Flesh and blood -With economic growth slowing, the ruling party has turned to a grab-bag of traditions as it attempts to portray itself as a natural outgrowth of Chinese culture.""These events are becoming bigger and bigger, because the state needs them to explain its legitimacy,"" said Zhu Dake, a cultural critic at Shanghai's Tongji University.At the same time it is looking to forge a single identity for an ethnically diverse population.""The state needs this bloodline,"" Zhu added. ""It's a political strategy. China is a multi-ethnic country. Chinese people are a mixed-up thing, rather than descendants of a single ancestor.""The message of unity applies to all ethnic Chinese, including the diaspora abroad and those in Taiwan, which split from the mainland in 1949 at the end of a civil war.Its new president Tsai -- from the traditionally pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party -- will be inaugurated on Friday.Among those lighting incense in Xinzheng last month was the head of Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office, which handles relations with Taipei.Similarly, the former vice-chairman of Taiwan's incumbent Kuomintang party Chun Chun-po attended another event at the reputed site of the emperor's death in neigbouring Shaanxi province, telling local media: ""As descendants of the Yellow Emperor, this is the happiest event in life.""His remarks recalled those of Taiwan's outgoing leader Ma Ying-jeou at last year's first cross-strait summit since 1949, when he said that people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait were ""of Chinese nationality"" and ""children of the Yellow Emperor"".For his part President Xi offered: “We are brothers connected by flesh even if our bones are broken, we are a family whose blood is thicker than water.""Both men's declarations were disparaged by many in Taiwan, where Tsai's message of Taiwanese identity resonated with voters and surveys show people feel increasingly separate from the mainland.But in the People's Republic, where the ruling party tightly controls presentations of history, there are few such concerns.After the official ceremonies at the Shaanxi tomb complex -- refurbished a decade ago at a cost of around 250 million yuan (US$38 million)-- thousands of ordinary citizens poured in, many prostrating themselves before the emperor's statue.""He definitely existed, there are ancient books and bone carvings which prove it,"" said student Shen Yuyan.""He's the ancestor of all Chinese ethnic groups and of Taiwanese people.""

Also Monday, regulators approved a plan to open Chinese stock markets wider to foreign investors by linking exchanges in Hong Kong and Shanghai. That followed the weekend announcement of a $40 billion Chinese-financed fund to improve trade links between Asian economies.At Tuesday's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, China is promoting its own regional free-trade pact, despite U.S. pressure to make progress on other initiatives. It marks the first time Beijing has taken the lead in promoting a multinational trade agreement.

(AP Photo) CHINA OUT The moves reflect Beijing's insistence on a bigger role in what it sees as U.S.-dominated economic and security structures to reflect China's status as the world's second-biggest economy.China says its motives are benign. But its growing economic weight as the top trading partner for most of its neighbors from South Korea to Australia could erode U.S. influence.""We are duty-bound to create and fulfill an Asia-Pacific dream for our people,"" the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, said Sunday in a speech at a business conference ahead of APEC.APEC is the first major international gathering in China since Xi took power, and brings together leaders including Presidents Barack Obama of the United States and Vladimir Putin of Russia. That gives Beijing a platform to lobby for a bigger leadership role.On Monday, Xi met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and shared an awkward handshake seen as a gesture toward easing two years of tensions between Asia's biggest economies.A spat between China and Japan over islands in the East China Sea and other issues has raised fears of a military confrontation, which could draw the United States, Japan's ally. On Friday, the two sides issued a joint statement agreeing to gradually resume political, diplomatic and security dialogues.Also this year, Beijing joined 20 other Asian countries in launching a regional development bank, despite U.S. objections that it needlessly duplicated the World Bank's work. In May, Xi called for creation of a new Asian structure for security cooperation based on a group that excludes Washington.On Monday, Obama insisted Washington sees no threat from Beijing's growing economic and political status.""The United States welcomes the rise of a prosperous, peaceful and stable China,"" the American leader said in a speech at the business conference.Still, American officials chafe at Beijing's insistence on promoting its proposed trade pact, the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific.It comes at a time when progress on a U.S.-led initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, has stalled. The chief U.S. trade envoy, Michael Froman, said Saturday the two pacts are ""not in competition,"" but he said Beijing should focus on wrapping up a U.S.-Chinese investment treaty and a separate agreement to lower barriers to trade in information technology.The TPP includes the United States, Japan and 10 other countries, but excludes China. Few details have been released but its promoters say it would reduce or eliminate tariffs on most goods among the member countries. That might hurt China by encouraging member countries to trade more with each other.China's initiative is much less ambitious and is aimed at reducing conflict among hundreds of bilateral trade agreements between pairs of Asia-Pacific economies.The U.S.-Chinese rivalry might help smaller countries in the region by giving them more choice among trade initiatives, economists say. They say, however, that governments are reluctant to take public positions on either pact to avoid antagonizing Beijing or Washington.On Saturday, APEC trade ministers issued a cautious endorsement of China's initiative. They sent to the leaders' meeting a proposal to launch a study of the plan but held off committing to deadlines or other details.The Chinese-South Korean trade agreement calls for the two nations to remove tariffs on more than 90 percent of goods over two decades. That includes finance, online commerce and 20 other areas but excludes the sensitive fields of autos and rice. South Korea said it was the first time China has included finance or telecommunications in such an agreement.Plans to link the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges could help to attract more regional investors. The Hong Kong market has long been open to global investors but most foreigners have been barred until now from China's mainland exchanges.

130,Chinese president kicks off 4-country global tour in Spain,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6434477/Chinese-president-kicks-4-country-global-tour-Spain.html," 16:29 BST, 27 November 2018 "," MADRID (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Spain on Tuesday for the first leg of an international tour that is being clouded by souring trade clashes with the United States, the only economy larger than China. Spain and China are expected to sign around 20 intergovernmental and business agreements on Wednesday, including rules to avoid double-taxation and a deal to export on-the-bone legs of Iberian ham to China. Both countries will also explore joint bids in infrastructure, energy and telecommunications projects in Africa and Latin America, a Spanish top official said. But the official, who was not authorized to be named, emphasized that Xi and Spain's Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, will also upgrade their countries' ""strategic framework relationship"" to reflect Beijing's greater influence in world affairs since the last state visit, in 2005. That move also aims to respond to the uncertainty raised by trade tensions between Beijing and Washington and a stricter European Union approach to Chinese investment since the bloc's parliament approved a new screening scheme to shield strategic sectors in its member states. ""In the past 13 years, one of the partners in this bilateral relationship has become more active and assertive internationally,"" said Mario Esteban, an expert with Spain's Royal Elcano Institute, an official think tank. ""Spain needs to acknowledge that while positioning itself for opportunities."" Britain's departure from the EU also makes Spain attractive to Beijing, Esteban said, as the country is seen as ""friendlier"" than other European countries.

""We hope and believe that Spain will continue to play a positive role in the EU for the sound and steady growth of China-EU relations,"" according to a commentary signed by the Chinese president in Spain's ABC, a conservative daily. The Spanish government says it will not officially back China's ""One Belt, One Road,"" a global multi-billion-dollar infrastructure loan initiative that many developing countries have embraced and that richer countries view with wariness. Xi arrived Tuesday at a private terminal in Madrid's airport accompanied by China's first lady, Peng Liyuan, as well as Chinese entrepreneurs and other Communist Party officials. On Wednesday, he will be welcomed with a lavish ceremony at the Royal Palace in central Madrid and will be treated to a state banquet by King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain. The mayor of Madrid will give Xi the keys of the Spanish capital and the Chinese leader will deliver a speech in the Spanish Senate.

Share this article Share 252 shares   The Washington Post article said China has been 'expanding a network of internment camps and systematic human rights abuses' in recent years, citing the example of the repression and torture faced by millions of ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang, a Muslim-majority region in the country's far west.  Former inmates have told of the horror after being detained in these camps, where they were physically and mentally tortured and as punishment, were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol. Since last spring, Chinese authorities have reportedly ensnared an estimated 900,000 to one million Muslims - and even foreign citizens - in what the Chinese government calls 'political re-education camps'. US citizen Gulchehra Hoja, a journalist for Radio Free Asia's (RFA) Uighur service, told Washington Post that she has had more than two dozen family members in China detained in the camps, including her elderly parents and her brother, who has not been heard from since his arrest last September. Many of her RFA colleagues have similar stories.'I hope and pray for my family to be let go and released, but I know if that happens they will still live under a constant threat,' she testified last week before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. 'I came to the United States to realise a dream, a dream of being able to tell the truth without fear.'          A child rests near the entrance to the mosque where the national flag is raised and a banner in red reads 'Love the party, Love the country' in the old city district of Kashgar, Xinjiang         The entrance to a jail which locals say is used to hold those undergoing political indoctrination program in Korla in Xinjiang. This detention campaign has swept across the north-west region              The Chinese flag flies over St. Joseph's (left), a government sanctioned church in Beijing. A Chinese flag is raised (right) near a minaret at the Ningxia Islamic institute in YinchuanThis detention campaign has swept across Xinjiang, a territory half the area of India, leading to what a US commission on China said in April is 'the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today'. The programme is a hallmark of China's emboldened state security apparatus under the deeply nationalistic, hard-line rule of President Xi Jinping. Chinese officials have largely avoided comment on the camps, but some are quoted in state media as saying that ideological changes are needed to fight separatism and Islamic extremism. Radical Muslim Uighurs have killed hundreds in recent years, and China considers the region a threat to peace in a country where the majority is Han Chinese. The internment programme aims to rewire the political thinking of detainees, erase their Islamic beliefs and reshape their very identities. The camps have expanded rapidly over the past year, with almost no judicial process or legal paperwork. The government has also destroyed thousands of religious buildings, banned long beards, veils and Muslim names such as 'Mohammed' and 'Jihad'. Women that wore face-covering veils are sometimes not allowed on buses. Unauthorised pilgrimages to Mecca were also restricted.          Children in traditionally Buddhist Tibet were required to sign an agreement to 'not take part in any form of religious activity' during the summer holidays, according to state media         Chinese government has often regarded the Dalai Lama (pictured) as a dangerous separatistJust last week, children in traditionally Buddhist Tibet were required to sign an agreement to 'not take part in any form of religious activity' during the summer holidays, according to a separate report by Global Times.The policy appears to reflect increasingly harsh restrictions on the Himalayan region's traditional Buddhist culture, largely aimed at reducing the influence of the region's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India. In April, the government published a white paper titled 'China's Policies and Practices on Protecting Freedom of Religious Belief', which states that religious groups 'must conduct religious activities in the Chinese context and practice core socialist values'.'China will uphold the principle that religions in China must be Chinese in orientation and provide active guidance to religions so that they can adapt themselves to the socialist society,' Xinhua previously reported, citing the white paper.          Residents walk through a security checkpoint into the Hotan Bazaar where a screen shows Chinese President Xi Jinping in Hotan, Xinjiang         The words 'Patriotism' and 'Democracy' are displayed near a Mao Zedong statue at a square in Kashgar, Xinjiang. Officials have been implementing strict regulations on religious practicesThe new rule of raising of the national flag is to strengthen national consciousness, help religious believers better practice socialist core values and carry forward the tradition of patriotism, the Global Times reported.  Religious venues are also required to display the national flat at prominent locations. The rule was established by heads and representatives of national religious groups including the Buddhist Association, the Taoist Association, the Islamic Association, and the Bishops' Conference of the Catholic Church in a joint conference in Beijing.Five legal religions exist in China - Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism - and have a total of nearly 200 million believers and more than 380,000 clerical personnel, according to Xinhua. "
132,Hong Kong leader offers condolences to wife of Chinese dissident Liu,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4696336/Hong-Kong-leader-offers-condolences-wife-Chinese-dissident-Liu.html," 11:33 BST, 14 July 2017 "," By Martin Howell and James Pomfret HONG KONG, July 14 (Reuters) - Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Friday she shares the compassion of people over the death of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo and acknowledged ""anxieties"" about ""incidents"" in the former British colony that can potentially erode its autonomy. Lam was speaking in her first interview with the international media since she was sworn in as the city's new leader by Chinese President Xi Jinping on July 1. ""Hong Kong people are always very compassionate and so I share that compassion of many Hong Kong people by sending my condolences to the wife and the family of Mr Liu,"" Lam, a devout Catholic, told a Reuters Newsmaker event in Hong Kong. Chinese officials have long branded Liu as a ""subversive"" so such comments are unusual and the only sympathetic remarks so far from a Beijing-backed leader regarding his death. Liu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for his efforts to promote democracy in China, died on Thursday at the age of 61 of multiple organ failure while in detention. Liu was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for ""inciting subversion of state power"". Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997. It enjoys wide-ranging freedoms not granted in mainland China, a promise of full democracy at some future date, and an independent judiciary under a so-called ""one country, two systems"" formula. But the abduction by mainland agents of Hong Kong booksellers who had published critical books on China, and Beijing's efforts to disqualify democratically elected, pro-independence lawmakers in the local legislature, have rattled confidence in that arrangement. 'ANXIETIES AND PERCEPTION' In a wide-ranging interview, Lam acknowledged concerns about certain ""individual incidents"" in the city. She said it was her duty to accurately reflect them to the central government in Beijing. ""I would say there are worries, there are anxieties, there is a strong perception over individual isolated incidents, but unless you've got evidence to prove there are clear breaches then it will remain at the level of anxieties and perception,"" Lam said, without elaborating. She did say, however, police were still investigating the booksellers' cases. Britain called the cases a ""serious breach"" of the Joint Declaration -- the 1984 treaty that paved the way for Hong Kong's return to China -- and said one of the booksellers, a British passport holder, had been removed from Hong Kong ""under duress"". Hong Kong's high court on Friday removed four opposition lawmakers from the city's legislative council for failing to sincerely take the oath of office, in a significant blow to the opposition that could weaken its one-third veto bloc in the 70-seat assembly. While the lawsuit had been initiated by her predecessor, Lam said she wouldn't intervene in the case ""Building bridges still has to be done in a lawful way. I don´t think this CE (chief executive) or any government official should compromise on the rule of law just because we want to be friendly. But I´m sure the judicial process will go on."" Speaking about Hong Kong's financial sector, Lam said it has a lot of catching up to do, particularly given big strides in financial technology on the mainland, and needs stronger leadership. She also expressed concern over stock price manipulation in the territory. XI'S HARDER LINE Xi took what some saw as an explicitly harder line about Hong Kong's future during his visit marking the 20th anniversary of the financial hub's return from British to Chinese rule. Xi warned in a speech that any attempt to endanger Chinese sovereignty and security, challenge its power, or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities would be acts that cross ""the red line"" and are ""absolutely impermissible"". Lam said she would seek to enact contentious national security laws, known as Article 23, ""as soon as possible,"" without giving a specific timetable, that would prohibit acts of treason, secession, sedition and subversion against China. A proposed blueprint for those laws in 2003, however, was seen as a grave threat to Hong Kong's autonomy, and drew a half-million protesters to the streets before it was finally shelved. Over the past two decades, Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems arrangement"" has come under considerable strain, as the city's opposition forces have agitated for full democracy and railed against creeping Chinese interference in various sectors including business, politics, media, law and education. The 60-year-old Lam has said she hopes to lead Hong Kong ""towards new glory"" in the next five years and heal divisions that have festered since the massive 2014 pro-democracy protests that blocked major roads in Hong Kong for 79 days. Lam also pledged to stand by the people of Hong Kong in protecting their rights. ""If our core values are being undermined by whatever things happened both in Hong Kong or not in Hong Kong, then of course I have that duty."" At times, Lam, the mother of two grown sons, showed a lighter side, boasting that she slept soundly through the night when asked about the insomnia of leadership. She expressed hopes she could ease the pressures of Hong Kong's pressure cooker school system, saying parents should let their children ""dream"" - and acknowledging that was not a traditional Asian ""Tiger Mum"" thing to say.

133,GRAPHIC-Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-5025093/GRAPHIC-Take-Five-World-markets-themes-week-ahead.html," 18:20 BST, 27 October 2017 "," By Marc Jones LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. 1/APPLE EYED Time for another slice of Apple. Amazon, Google and Twitter may have helped put to bed worries of a mass tech roll-over, but investors will be nervously awaiting results from Apple due on Thursday after reports of tepid demand for its new iPhones. Just by its size it will have a strong impact on market sentiment. But for all the focus on the gains made by the U.S. FAANGs as they have come to be known (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google), there are other stocks that are roaring. Europe´s tech sector, for example, hit its highest in nearly 16 years this week after stellar results from the likes of ST Micro and AMS - which is up 190 percent this year - and the STOXX 600 tech sector is far outperforming the Nasdaq in dollar terms. Parts of the new iPhone, and features including face recognition technology and motion sensors, are made or designed in Europe, so Apple's results could have a far-reaching impact. Doing the heavy lifting: investors eye tech-tonic shifts for Europe´s industrials Apple component supplier AMS's confident forecast boosts share price Imaging business, Apple link, power up STMicro profits No end in sight for tech giant share gains 2/GOING UP To hear some economists talk, the Bank of England (BoE) is about to make a big mistake - raise interest rates just as the UK economy heads into what could be a major storm. If all goes as scripted, the bank will hike borrowing costs on Thursday for the first time in more than 10 years, with the consensus for a rise to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent. It may be little more than a few basis points, but for markets and sterling in particular it matters. The currency is up more than 6 percent this year against the dollar but is down over 3 percent on the euro and whether or not this turns out to be a one-and-done move on rates - or the start of something more - could be crucial. The BoE is not the only central bank in Europe expected to be going for a hike that day. The Czech Republic looks set to raise its interest rates for the second time this year. The Czech crown is the world's top performing currency, so investors will be watching Prague's moves closely too. British inflation at 5-1/2-year high in September, rate hike on track New Bank of England deputy says not ready to vote for rate hike Bank of England's Carney sees Brexit pushing up inflation, slowing growth Czech central bank's Hampl: interest rate rises needed 3/THAT'S WHAT XI SAID At a key, twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress, Chinese President Xi Jinping set broad ""new era"" goals for a modern socialist ""strong power"" with leading influence on the world stage by 2050. Crucially, while keeping near-term growth targets, China will not set numerical goals to double GDP from 2021, breaking with past practice. In a bid to move from high-speed to high-quality growth, Xi said China would deepen economic and financial reforms and further open its markets to foreign investors. Its ""belt and road"" development strategy suggests a vision for China to be more integrated into the world economy. There's a high degree of synchronisation already. Its manufacturing cycle has been moving in tandem with benchmark U.S. 10-year T-note yields in recent years. There are many obstacles along the road, high corporate leveraging being the most obvious one, but if Xi's Chinese dream is to be achieved, it may be that a few decades from now global markets will respond to the Chinese economy and not the other way around. China says will not set target to double GDP from 2021, in change from the past China enshrines 'Xi Jinping Thought', key Xi ally to step down Pressure on as ""Belt and Road"" enshrined in Chinese party charter China's focus on quality of growth to be positive for its ratings - Moody's 4/EMERGING STRAINS 2017 has so far been one of the best years ever for emerging markets investors with stellar gains on everything from Chinese stocks to local currency sovereign debt. So this week's beating for South Africa's rand after dire budget forecasts, and pain for other high-yielders like the Turkish lira, have triggered some understandable profit taking. The wider worry, though, is if the dollar starts barreling higher and global bond yields climb more meaningfully investors will be back to worrying about the ghosts and ghouls that come with record levels of debt, much of which has been borrowed in dollars. South Africa's budget woes raise stakes for Nov. 24 rating reviews Contagion danger rises as reeling rand hits 11-mth low 5/ON THE JOBS The monthly installment of U.S. jobs data arrives on Friday. Last month's figures saw the first monthly decline in non farm payrolls in seven years. The culprit: Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which hit Texas and Florida. One reason was leisure and hospitality payrolls sliding 111,000, the largest since records began in 1939. Employment at restaurants and bars fell 104,700. That fall in the sector's employment shifted ""the mix of workers towards higher paying industries"" and ""biased average hourly earnings higher"", analysts at Morgan Stanley say, but October's numbers are expected to normalise. In general, investors will want to see broad-based wage growth. There's a sweet spot, though, and we could be right in it. Wages are expected to show between 2.5 percent and 3 percent growth after 2.9 percent in September. But if it comes in above 3 percent it could cause concerns about the impact on company profits. This all matters for the Federal Reserve as it looks to nudge up interest rates again before the year is out. There is also the small matter of who Donald Trump nominates as the next head of the central bank that could also be announced next week. (Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Mark Potter)"

The message out of China is towards a more open and liberal mindset in terms of international trade.'The second-largest economy in the world is a major importer of raw materials, and should they commit to their pledge to lower trade barriers, it is likely to benefit companies like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta.'17:07 FTSE 100 closes up 72.00 points at 7266.7516:15 Thousands of City jobs at risk after Deutsche Bank sacked bossThousands of City jobs could be on the block at Deutsche Bank after it fired chief executive John Cryan.The Yorkshireman was forced to quit by his own board amid concerns that his already-brutal programme of cuts does not go far enough.He has been replaced by insider Christian Sewing, who has hinted that the troubled German lender’s once-mighty investment bank will be slashed further.16:03 Recruiter hails solid growthRecruitment company Robert Walters enjoyed first quarter success with a 17 per cent increase in recruitment fee revenue it revealed today.Europe saw an impressive growth rate of 32 per cent with the biggest growth countries, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands each growing over 35%.In the UK there was significant growth outside of the capital with Manchester, Milton Keynes and St Albans being hailed as standout stars.UK Q1 fee income was up 6 per cent at £25.2 million with the economy continuing to shrug off fears of a Brexit-induced hiring freeze.15:47 BoE: We helped UK households through financial crisisBank of England chiefs have simultaneously lauded their effectiveness in nursing British households through the financial crisis and hinted another rate rise is imminent.In a speech at the University of Melbourne in Australia, the Bank's chief economist Andy Haldane said the average UK family has benefited from a cumulative £90,000 boost to their wealth since the 2008 crisis due to its policies to support the economy.The figure includes the impact of house price rises and stock market climbs. With these stripped out Haldane said it is a more modest but not insignificant £9,000.'The material loosening of UK monetary policy after 2007 has had a significantly positive effect on employment, income and wealth, without which average living standards in the UK would be materially lower,' Haldane said.12:32 Check in with the afternoon marketsEuropean markets are 'buoyant' according to Connor Campbell of Spread Ex.He said: 'The European markets remained buoyant in the aftermath of President Xi’s openness-eying speech, with the prospect of some sizeable growth to come from the US session likely to keep the gains going.'Though it trailed its more ebullient peers, the FTSE still managed a respectable 40 point rise as the day went on, a move that took the UK index back above 7200 and to levels not seen in around a month.'This came despite a decent showing from the pound; sterling jumped 0.2% against both the dollar and the euro, keeping above $1.415 against the former while knocking on the door of €1.15 against the latter. That’s because the currency got a bit of a boost in the form of some pro-rate hike comments from Ian McCafferty – the gains only weren’t larger due to the MPC member’s already well-known hawkish stance.'As mentioned, the certain elements of the Eurozone were more than ready to embrace the idea that the US and China are stepping back from the trade war brink. The DAX surged over 140 points, leaving the German index to dance around the 12400 mark for the first time since the middle of March.'12:15 Regulator increases scrutiny of 'big six' accounting firmsThe UK's six largest accounting firms are facing a regulatory crackdown after the watchdog said it would ""enhance"" its monitoring of the sector amid growing criticism of auditing failures.The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said the move is meant to avoid instability in the financial sector and ""systemic deficiencies"" in the networks of the sector's biggest companies - BDO, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC and Grant Thornton.It plans to focus on ""critical"" areas including evidence of auditing quality, risk management and controls, financial soundness, values and behaviours as well as leadership and governance.The watchdog said it had already started work on monitoring risk reporting, contingency planning and IT security across the companies, and plans to report back to the firms on its findings.11:59 Full story on British Gas price hikeThe full story on British Gas's announcement of a price hike is available to read here.The energy firm is to increase bills for 4.1 million dual-fuel customers by an average of 5.5% - £60 a year.

The government set a target for a third of all contracts to be with small businesses by 2022.It follows the collapse of construction firm Carillion and the saga that followed with questions asked about why the government gave public contracts to a firm in such difficulty. Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said: 'This government is listening to the business community and is committed to levelling the playing field for smaller suppliers to win work in the public sector.'11:04 Lettings agency boosts profitLetting agency Belvoir Lettings has reported a 14% jump in group revenue for 2017, up to £11.3m.  Profit before tax at the group was up 62% to £3.9m, rising from £2.4m in 2016.The group manages 58,020 properties.It has increased final dividend to 3.5p, meaning the total dividend for the year is 6.9p, up from 6.8p in 2016.CEO Dorian Gonsalves said: 'We are pleased to report another year of strong growth for the Group, in terms of both revenues and profitability. Our franchisees, who are mostly owner-operators, have continued to grow organically, through diversification and by making local portfolio acquisitions, all of which have contributed to our adjusted profit in 2017 being up 39%.'Looking to 2018, the Board remains confident that the Belvoir Group will benefit from further consolidation within the sector, further integration of our recent acquisitions to deliver additional efficiencies and diversification of property-related services offered through our franchised networks, to ensure a continued increase in shareholder value.'10:33 Eddie Stobart reports falling profits despite solid revenue growthHaulage firm Eddie Stobart has reported strong growth in its underlying earnings last year, rising to £623.9m in 2017 - up from £549m in 2016.However its statutory profits fell to £9.9m, down from £11.2m in 2016.The company has proposed a final dividend of 4.4 pence a share, a total of 5.8 pence a share for the full year. Chief executive Alex Laffey said: 'We have made good progress in implementing our strategy of becoming a leading provider of end-to-end supply chain solutions. This has been demonstrated by our performance over the past 12 months, especially within our two key growth sectors, Manufacturing, Industrial and Bulk, and E-commerce.'Overall we are pleased with our progress in 2017.  The new financial year has started well and in line with the Board's expectations.'09:55 British Gas to hike bills for four million householdsBritish Gas has announced plans to increase energy bills for dual-fuel customers on its standard variable tariff by an average of 5.5%, a rise of £60 a year. The change will hit 4.1 million households across the UK.09:50 Russian rouble tumblesThe value of the Russian rouble has plummeted amid a second day of fierce selling of the currency. It has fallen a further 4.5% today after an initial 4% drop on Monday. One dollar now buys 63.45 roubles.Fresh US sanctions and geopolitical risks emanating from actions in Syria have shaken Russian investors.09:40 Card Factory revenues tread higherCard Factory reported a 4.3% increase in revenues in 2017 to £398.2 million and said that like-for-like store sales were up 0.4% while online sales were barely changed at £19.3 million, up from £19.2 million.However, the company’s profit before tax was lower at £82.8 million, down from £83.7 million the year before.09:17 Hostelworld revenues upHostelworld has reported a surge in bookings and revenue for 2017, and upped its shareholder dividend as a result.Group bookings increased by 6% (to 7.5m bookings) with core Hostelworld brand bookings up 13%, the company said today, with 'continued strong performance' in Asia with bookings growth of 12%. The group's net revenue increased 8% to €86.7m, with profits after tax of €11.2m.It has proposed a 15% increase in its final dividend of 12.0 euro cent per share, up from the 10.4 euro cents it offered in 2016.08:50 UK exports to accelerate in 2018British exports will expand at the fastest pace since 2011 according to a survey published by HSBC.Exports of UK goods and services will increase by 10% this year, hitting £639bn.The weak pound has provided a boost to British companies with earnings overseas while the economies of key trading partners have soared despite the UK economy failing to keep up.The US, Germany and France are among the top markets for UK exporters.08:43 Import tariff comments caught the ear of markets...Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at Spread Ex, also reacted to President Xi's market-calming speech.He said: 'Now, Xi still threw plenty of shade at the Orange Menace, calling on other countries to ‘reject power politics’ and embrace openness lest they be ‘assigned to the dustbin of history’.'Yet it was his comments on import tariffs, which he said would be ‘significantly’ lower for autos, and his promise that the country would do more to enforce intellectual property rights of international firms, ostensibly a key concern for Trump, that really caught the ear of the markets.'08:39 President Xi provides relief for marketsPresident Xi has extended an olive branch in the ongoing trade dispute with the US, but will Donald Trump accept it?Markets have breathed a sigh of relief nonetheless.Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, said: 'President Xi’s speech overnight appears to have struck the right tone, providing some relief for investors who have been buffeted by the recent war of words between Trump and China over trade. 'While there was already an overwhelming sense that Chinese officials were keen to achieve a negotiated settlement before the proposed tariffs do any lasting damage to either the Chinese or US economies, today’s speech was the clearest indication yet that China is prepared to take concrete steps to address some of Trump’s chief criticisms. 'The big question is whether President Trump will now take the olive branch offered by Xi’s conciliatory approach and dial down the rhetoric from his side too.'Corporate profits have taken a back seat to trade tensions and increased volatility over the past few weeks, but as the US earnings season starts in earnest this week, they will take on huge significance.  Equities received a huge boost when the US tax reform bill was signed into law in December and investors will want to see that this is feeding through to the bottom line to justify their continued faith. 'A good earnings season would do a lot to regain some equilibrium and provide some much-needed relief and calm for beleaguered investors.'08:23 Shoppers avoided the high street as Beast from the East tore across UK, report findsThe Beast from the East kept shoppers away from stores in March as people huddled in the warmth of their homes amid the big freeze, figures show.A report from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and KPMG, covering the final days of February to the end of March, said the period was volatile as the run-up to Easter helped to offset the impact of the ""seemingly endless"" cold weather on sales.It said UK retail sales increased by 1.4% on a like-for-like basis compared with March 2017, when they had decreased 1% from the preceding year.On a total basis, sales rose 2.3% annually in March, against a decline of 0.2% in March 2017.08:23 FTSE treads higherChinese president Xi Jinping's softened tone in the trade dispute sent Asian markets higher overnight, helping support a rise on our own FTSE 100.It opened 0.51% higher, gaining 36 points.It stands at 7,220 currently.{""id"":""5597873"",""channel"":""/money"",""pageUrl"":""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5597873/FTSE-LIVE-UK-stocks-shift-higher-China-softens-trade-talk.html"",""status"":""running"",""greenBox"":{""body"":""""},""modifiedOrder"":1}00    if (!window.LiveCommentary) window.LiveCommentary = {};    window.LiveCommentary.commentaryConf = JSON.parse('{""publicNodeHost"":""livecommentary.dailymail.co.uk/apps/livecommentary_public"",""websocketNodeHost"":""https://livecomjoy.dailymail.co.uk/apps/livecommentary_public"",""startTime"":1552993277,""appVersion"":3,""frontEndHostOverride"":""www.dailymail.co.uk"",""dmWebsiteOrigin"":""https://www.dailymail.co.uk"",""pushMissingPostsOnReconnect"":false}');   "

Sportsmail talks to Aston Villa’s owner-in-waiting, Dr Tony Xia  ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3602825/Saviour-dreamer-Sportsmail-talks-Aston-Villa-s-owner-waiting-Dr-Tony-Xia.html," 00:15 BST, 22 May 2016 ","Tony Xia, Aston Villa’s owner-in-waiting, chuckles when asked if he is a dollar billionaire.‘I think it’s rather more than that,’ says the 39-year-old Chinese businessman, explaining that just a few months ago he sold one of his companies, Teamax, for £430million, which is sitting in a bank account waiting to be spent, in part on Villa.‘I own quite a lot of private businesses and I think I can sell some of them for the same amount or more,’ adds Xia, who has provided The Mail on Sunday with a bank transfer certificate purporting to show the funds from the Teamex deal.         Chinese businessman Dr Tony Xia has agreed a deal to buy recently relegated football club Aston VillaSpeaking from his home in Beijing on Saturday in an hour-long exclusive interview, he revealed not just the financial nuts and bolts of the deal that could put him in control at Villa Park within weeks but much more about his plans for the club.  ‘If’, for the moment, is the key word in the phrase ‘if his plans come to fruition’. Xia was happy to talk about his past, his private life, his business career and his finances.Within weeks he will need to prove, beyond doubt and with hard cash, that he has the assets and ability to buy Villa and fund it. Initial checks corroborate some of the information.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Aston Villa takeover facing Premier League and Football...    Aston Villa's ambitious new owner Dr Tony Xia lays out £50m...    Share this articleShare   But the reality is that China has an opaque business environment and a chaotically expanding economy. In the short time since Xia hit the headlines, it is impossible to verify everything about him.Even his birth-date has been questioned. Xia, whose full name is Xia Jiantong, says he was born on October 26, 1976, and that the confusion arose because he started school as a precocious four-year-old whose parents needed for legal reasons to pretend he was six.What is fact, and The Mail on Sunday has verified, is that he studied landscape design at Harvard University in the late 1990s, started a design company, XWHO, in Boston, Massachusetts in March 1999, co-owned by his girlfriend at the time Cong Liu and one of his lecturers, Prof Charles Harris.         Speaking from his home in Beijing on Saturday in an hour-long exclusive interview, Xia revealed his plans         Xia presented us with this bank statement with a balance of £4.1bn yuan to prove his wealth ahead of the dealRegistries in the USA and China show the company relocated to Hangzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang, where Xia also started Teamex, a planning company that has provided services as hundreds of new cities have been built.Firms operating across IT, health, transport, design, tourism and finance were added. Xia’s business empire exists under an umbrella organisation called the RECON Group but most of the subsidiaries are privately held, not stockmarket listed. The most visible, Lotus, has been loss-making but Xia is open about this and says it is turning around.He insists that within a few months a series of major mergers and acquisitions will bring a bigger chunk of his business into the public domain. ‘I would rather keep a low profile,’ he says. It is pointed out that buying a football club just relegated from the Premier League is not a clever way to do that. ‘Actually you’re right,’ he laughs.‘There’s been more attention than I’d expect or could predict. I knew people would pay attention, but not this much.’         Within weeks he will need to prove, beyond doubt and with hard cash,  he has the assets to buy Villa and fund itScrutiny, he is finding out, comes as part of the package and he discloses what he will pay for Villa. Lerner, the American owner, wanted more than £100m but Xia says he has settled for £52m up front, plus Xia’s guarantee of clearing Villa’s overdraft at HSBC of £24.5m. Xia says that £74.5m is thus sitting in a ring-fenced bank account.Lerner will earn a £30m bonus if Villa return to the Premier League within three years and another £10m if they stay there for another three years after promotion.‘I appreciate it’s a big deal for Villa fans,’ he says. ‘But actually in pure business terms, I’m working on acquisitions much bigger than this.’ He says, for example, that within months he will complete a $3.5bn takeover of a US logistics firm.If true, Villa fans could well have got themselves an owner if not quite as rich as Roman Abramovich then certainly extremely wealthy. Whether he, like them, is a lifelong supporter, is less clear.Xia spent five months on an exchange at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1998-99 and saw one Villa home game during that time. He says he cannot remember who they played, or the score. This hardly smacks of an awestruck devotee.         Xia spent five months on an exchange at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1998-99 and saw one Villa home game       He insists he has kept an eye on Villa’s fortunes since but admits he also has a soft spot for Arsenal and is rather more convincing waxing lyrical on Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry. ‘I can assure you my first and only football priority from now will be Aston Villa though,’ he says.Xia says he has offered the manager’s job to one of three candidates in the public domain but won’t confirm which of Roberto Di Matteo, Nigel Pearson or David Moyes it is.‘When the manager is appointed, we will discuss his budget,’ Xia adds. It is expected between £20m and £50m will be available for transfers, depending on the case made by whoever gets the job.The long-term plan include a football museum and theme park to attract football tourists from China and India, and the recruitment of young Chinese players to Villa’s academy, if not as formal scholars then on exchange programmes.         Roberto Di Matteo, pictured during his spell with Schalke in 2015, is the new owner's leading managerial target         Former Manchester United manager David Moyes remains a possibility, with Xia keen to take his time Xia says he will spend a lot of time in Birmingham over the next year, buying a house for himself and his wife Sally and daughter Charlotte, who turns two this summer. He says buying a club has been a long-term aim. He has played football since college; Harvard records show him in the university league. He says love of the sport and a desire to diversify his business interests are his main driver, although the knowledge that China’s president, Xi Jinping, wants China to become a footballing superpower, is not lost on him.He has known the president for some time, albeit not closely. Xi was the most senior government official in Zhejiang Province when Xia relocated there to the same industrial park as Jack Ma, China’s richest man in recent years.President Xi visited both men’s companies when they were still on the up. Xia dreams he might be tempted to Villa Park too.For now, that remains a dream, just as Xia knows his plans for Villa remain a dream in the eyes of many. He still has everything to prove.

137,China's Xi revives Long March myths to rally Communist Party,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3847062/Chinas-Xi-revives-Long-March-myths-rally-Communist-Party.html," 10:37 BST, 18 October 2016 ","China's Xi revives Long March myths to rally Communist Party By Afp   Published: 10:37 BST, 18 October 2016  |  Updated: 10:38 BST, 18 October 2016                e-mail         As China marks 80 years since the Red Army ended its epic Long March, the Communist Party is attacking revisionist history in an effort to compel reverence for its founding legend.Facing annihilation at the hands of Nationalists during China's civil war in 1934, 80,000 Communist soldiers and leaders -- Mao Zedong among them -- broke through encircling forces and embarked on a gruelling escape.Nine out of 10 had deserted or died by the time the last units reached Yanan in the northern province of Shaanxi as much as two years later, where Mao and his cohorts founded a base from which they went on to take over the country.        Mao Zedong dreamed of transforming China into a communist paradise ©Nicolas Asfouri (AFP/File) According to Communist Party lore the marchers travelled at least 12,500 kilometres (7,750 miles) through some of the country's most remote and hazardous terrain.The anniversary is being marked this week, with a daily drumbeat of newspaper articles and op-eds -- plus dozens of TV dramas, documentaries, trivia contests, radio broadcasts and special exhibitions -- extolling their heroism.President Xi Jinping has put his stamp on the occasion, visiting museums in the northern region of Ningxia and Beijing.Xi has declared the party must emulate the march's spirit in pursuit of his ""Chinese Dream"", a vaguely defined promise of national rejuvenation, and the party's centenary goal to build a ""moderately prosperous society"" by 2021.""We, the new generation, should accomplish our new Long March,"" he said.The drive comes just ahead of a top party meeting in the capital this month, with speculation mounting that Xi may delay appointing a successor and seek to stay in power beyond the traditional 10-year term.Evoking the legend is ""a good reminder to everybody that the party actually did, and does, stand for something"" despite the Communist Party's loss of ""purpose and legitimacy"", Trey McArver, a London-based China politics analyst at Trusted Sources research firm, told AFP.Xi's embrace of the Long March reflects his desire to gather the party's passion around him and channel Mao's authority, said Liu Tong, historian at Shanghai Jiaotong University.China's governance has become more focused on the leader under Xi, a style that ""mimics Mao's in many respects"", Liu said, adding that celebrating the Long March connects Xi to ""the Communists' symbol of triumph"".But much recent propaganda surrounding the march, he added, ""departed from the truth"".- Politics over history -In reality the long retreat was a ""military disaster"" for the Communists, argues University of Hong Kong historian Xu Guoqi.Rather than Mao's brilliance, it was Japan's invasion of China that saved the party by diverting and weakening the Nationalists, he told AFP.Survivors have spoken of rapes, executions, kidnappings and forced requisitions of grain by the Red Army on the routes it walked.Two British men who spent more than a year following the Red Army's route calculated that it was about 6,100 kilometres -- far shorter than officially claimed.Others such as documentary filmmaker Sun Shuyun have interviewed survivors and witnesses who reported that celebrated incidents such as the Battle for Luding Bridge, where Red Army heroes reportedly made a perilous crossing under heavy gunfire, did not occur as described.Such accounts have been blasted in state media.Those who cast doubt on the 12,500-kilometre figure are guilty of ""historical nihilism"", wrote Lu Yi, a scholar at the Central Party School, an institution where Communist Party officials are trained, in a commentary in the People's Liberation Army Daily newspaper last month.Lu singled out Sun and the British travellers as examples of people who ""fly the flag of 'restoring the truth' to maliciously sever history and fabricate lies"".The widely circulated commentary ended with a warning that ""this historical nihilism must be firmly refuted"".Warren Sun of Monash University in Australia told AFP that while Xi understands the ""less-than-savoury real story"" of the march, in ""issuing the new marching order, political necessity clearly overrides any historical truth"".- Mandatory homage -Although Mao's own units reached Yanan in 1935, China celebrates the reunification of Communist forces on October 22 the following year, and the 80th anniversary is being marked with museum exhibitions across the country.At the National Museum on Tiananmen Square, visitors gazed at oil paintings of Mao astride a white steed and displays of the Great Helmsman's handgun.An elderly visitor named Shan said he admired the early Communist Party members, whose achievements ""represent the indomitable spirit and strong mind of the Chinese nation"".""Today, people's thinking has relaxed,"" he said.But several younger visitors said their state-run companies had bussed them in for the exhibit and required them to write a report about it.One group of visitors posed with a Communist Party flag at the entrance.Asked if she considered whether the official history was distorted, a 30-year-old woman surnamed Feng answered: ""History is never objective. As ordinary people, we cannot tell whether history is true. But we can still learn from the spirit of the Long March.”        A poem by Mao Zedong is displayed at the National Museum in Beijing as part of an exhibition to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Red Army's Long March ©Fred Dufour (AFP)         Mao Zedong on October 1, 1949, declared the foundation of the People's Republic of China in Beijing's Tiananmen Square         China's National Museum in Beijing is hosting an exhibition to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Red Army's Long March ©Fred Dufour (AFP)         Speculation is mounting that Chinese President Xi Jinping may delay appointing a successor and seek to stay in power beyond the traditional 10-year term ©Lintao Zhang (Pool/AFP/File)         China is marking 80 years since the Red Army ended its epic Long March "
138,Dane at vanguard of China's World Cup quest,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4794592/Dane-vanguard-Chinas-World-Cup-quest.html," 05:44 BST, 16 August 2017 ","          Children attend a football training session in the suburbs of Guangzhou, in southern China's Guangdong province  It is the World Cup final and China beat one of the traditional heavyweights showcasing a brand of fast, attacking football that their opponents cannot live with. That, along with hosting the World Cup, is the dream of Chinese President Xi Jinping -- and a Dane at a leading Chinese club is doing his part to try to make it happen. Mads Davidsen does not necessarily think China will win the World Cup but he has no doubt that the world's most populous country can finally become a competitive force and reach the World Cup knockout stages in about 15 years. The 34-year-old Davidsen is well-placed to judge: he is technical director at Shanghai SIPG and as part of his wide-ranging remit the Chinese Super League (CSL) club brought in the likes of Brazilian international Oscar for 60 million euros from Chelsea, and lured Andre Villas-Boas as coach. Foreign players and coaches have attracted unprecedented interest from the CSL, but China's national team remain an embarrassment -- 77th in the FIFA rankings and with only one World Cup appearance in 2002, when they failed to get a point or even score. Davidsen, involved in top-level Chinese football since 2013 when he worked under former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson at Guangzhou R&F, pinpoints coaching as the crux of China's problem. And Davidsen, who holds a UEFA Pro licence coaching badge and oversees football development at SIPG right down to the club's five-year-olds, told AFP that focusing on famous imports misses the overarching picture. - The big plan -          Shanghai SIPG football club director Mads Davidsen takes notes during an interview in Shanghai, on August 7, 2017  ""It's all part of the big plan. Chinese football said, 'How can we improve the league fast? OK, get in good foreign players who can promote the league, good foreign coaches who will lift the current local players and then we are rolling'. That's what's happened the last three years. ""Everything in this plan is about improving the national team. I work for Shanghai SIPG, but where is SIPG in this project? Of course to promote our club and business, but also to help the president improve the national team."" Contrary to the perceptions of some, Davidsen said Chinese players have good basic technique -- better even than Europeans in some cases. They also have the right attitude and work-rate, he said, and respect for authority in China means they adhere to instructions from coaches. And Chinese have another, innate quality. ""I've never had more fast players. And where's football going? It's getting faster so it's crucial to have pace, it's a huge advantage,"" said Davidsen, whose role includes overseeing SIPG's development of 10,000 players aged five to 13 at academies across China. So why has China failed to develop even one world-class footballer? ""It all comes down to the coaches and the environment around them,"" said Davidsen, who played in Denmark's third tier and by 29 was on the staff at leading Danish club Brondby, before moving to China in 2012. ""The main development area is that the coaches here are on too low a level. A key point: the Chinese coaches must travel more, see more of football round the world to understand the demands of the modern game."" - Patience needed - Xi -- whose government is throwing money at football -- and China's success-starved fans will have to be patient. ""I have seen five or six-year-olds who can do things they cannot do in Europe because technically they train repetition, so many hours of repetition,"" said Davidsen. ""In China they accept a lot of training because they have a different mindset and tough mentality.""

139,Model village shows cracks in Xi's fight to end China poverty,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4972440/Model-village-shows-cracks-Xis-fight-end-China-poverty.html," 05:32 BST, 12 October 2017 ","          On the outskirts of the model village, farmers still live in ramshackle homes and move along rutted lanes  When President Xi Jinping last came to central China's Lankao county, it was famous for two things: poverty and the government official who reputedly died trying to end it. Three years later, the hardscrabble area has undergone a Cinderella-like transformation, waltzing across the national poverty line just in time for the Communist Party's twice-a-decade congress on October 18. With its freshly paved roads, modern community centre and memorial to Xi's visit, Lankao's Zhangzhuang village has become a showpiece for the president's ambitious and politically critical campaign to wipe out rural poverty by 2020. But a drastically different picture emerges on the outskirts, where farmers still live in ramshackle homes and move along rutted lanes. The contrast highlights the difficulty of spreading the wealth of the world's second-largest economy, a central mission for Xi as he prepares to accept a second five-year term as general secretary of the Communist Party. Success is crucial for the credibility of the party, which came to power promising a radical redistribution of the nation's wealth, and would help solidify Xi's stature as the most powerful leader in decades. - 'A bubble economy' - In the three years since Xi's visit, Lankao's official poverty rate dropped from 12 percent to under two, making it just the second county to be removed from a national registry of almost 600 poor areas. Officials attribute the success to better directed aid and low-interest micro-loans that have helped needy families increase their income by buying livestock and farming equipment. But Xi also took personal responsibility for the area of more than 760,000 in 2014 as part of a programme that paired top party leaders with local governments.          A billboard celebrates President Xi Jinping's visits to the once-hardscrabble Zhangzhuang village  He chose Lankao -- and Zhangzhuang specifically -- for its association with Jiao Yulu, an official who became a national hero after famously working himself to death helping farmers eke out a living along along the flood-prone Yellow River five decades ago. The president's visit ""gave us encouragement and inspiration,"" said local official Wang Qifu, speaking by a massive monument to Jiao in the bustling county seat. After the leader came, ""doing poorly wouldn't do."" But life in Xi's dream village is surrounded by another reality. While everyone agrees Lankao has changed enormously since Xi's visits in March and May 2014, those on Zhangzhuang's outskirts complain the gains have not been equitable. The backs of houses along the road to the village have been whitewashed to give the appearance of wealth, but on the other side, narrow, muddy streets run past homes with broken windows and crumbling bricks. ""We haven't seen any changes here,"" said one elderly woman, a farmer who declined to give her name. ""The people with connections to the village government have all shaken off poverty. Those without connections haven't."" Many residents still feel poor, complaining there is little money in farming and earning more means moving to urban areas. To tackle the problem, the county has encouraged cooperatives to grow more profitable crops such as melons, established industrial parks, and also dedicated several large memorials to Jiao -- and its own Xi-fuelled success -- hoping ""red tourism"" will create much-needed jobs.          A statue commemorates Jiao Yulu who became a national hero after working himself to death helping farmers eke out a living  A busload of foreign ministry employees sporting Communist Party lapel pins recently made the pilgrimage, stopping at Jiao's memorial hall and a village that has prospered by making traditional Chinese instruments. In May, 27-year-old Peng Biao -- a village official -- and his wife turned their family home near the Yellow River into a small, stylish restaurant, hoping to cash in on the tourism boom. Three dishes cost about 40 yuan ($6.50), almost a week's income for one of the 23 households still on the village's poverty list. Lankao has made good progress, Peng said, but if the county cannot create more jobs ""it's just a bubble economy. On the surface, people may seem well-off, but actually, they won't have even a single yuan in their wallet."" - 'A bottleneck' - Ahead of the party congress, state media have heavily promoted the ""Lankao Model"" and the ""Jiao Yulu spirit"" to combat poverty. According to official figures, around 700 million have escaped poverty since China began its economic reforms in 1978. But the gap between rich and poor ""has become quite alarming"" for Beijing, said Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese leadership at Washington's Brookings Institution. ""The whole thing about China's economic rise is you see the economic disparity has become a bottleneck.""          One village has prospered thanks to a project to make traditional Chinese instruments  In 2016, around 43.3 million rural residents still lived below the country's official poverty line of 2,300 yuan ($346) a year at 2010 prices, according to official statistics. The threshold changes based on location but Lankao's $460 is still well below the $694 that the World Bank considers ""extreme poverty"". Achieving Xi's goal of ""moderate prosperity"" by 2020 could prove difficult even for a county that has benefited from the president's support. ""In other places, it might not be a big problem, but we just shook off poverty,"" Wang said, ""our foundation is pretty bad."""

Russia denies the accusations.Russia and China express impatience with a perceived American domination of world affairs, often vetoing or abstaining from US-led initiatives on the UN Security Council.The often blunt-spoken Putin told APEC delegates the two sides would seek to increase use of their yuan and ruble currencies, saying the dollar's influence would ""objectively decline"".- 'Candid' conversations -China and the United States have already jousted in Beijing over differing visions of Asia-Pacific trade integration, adding to discord over rights, cyber-espionage, and territorial disputes.The White House has said it expects ""candid and in-depth conversations"" between Obama and Xi.As well as the row with Japan -- a US security ally which Washington is bound by treaty to defend if attacked -- Beijing's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea has also rankled rival claimants to its waters.Another likely topic between Xi and Obama is North Korea, following the surprise weekend release of two Americans imprisoned by the secretive state.Beijing is Pyongyang's closest ally.China put on a dazzling welcome for the APEC leaders, lighting up the capital's huge Olympic park as they arrived for an opening banquet in high-collared traditional Chinese tunics with a sleek modern design.The event culminates Tuesday with a formal leaders' summit.APEC kicks off a week of high-level summitry that will see Obama and other top leaders travel next to Myanmar for the East Asia Summit, followed by G20 talks in Brisbane, Australia.China is hosting APEC for the first time since 2001, when it was still re-emerging as a world economic power.But in a speech Sunday, Xi underlined how much has changed by offering his vision of an ""Asia-Pacific dream"", in which China's continued rise offers ""infinite promise"" to all.

China is really serious about this.         Indian security forces march during the Republic Day parade in New DelhiOn December 5 in Beijing, President Xi Jinping, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) attended a two-day meeting during which he called for 'a smaller army with better combat capability and optimised structure.'WarfareXi spoke about the informationised modern warfare and emphasised the importance of joint operations.He called for readjusting and optimising the military's structure: 'new type of forces must be developed, the ratios between different types of forces must be rationalised, and the number and the scale of the military be downsized.'This raises two important questions. While undertaking these reforms, has China not taken a too large bite, which is now difficult to chew?The other question is: what does this mean for India? Xinhua remarked that December 2015 'marked a fresh start in the history of the Chinese Armed Forces, as the nation embarked on a long march of deepening military reform.'On December 31, new services were created, namely, the PLA Army, the PLA Rocket Force and the PLA Strategic Support Force and a few weeks later, the seven erstwhile Military Regions were regrouped into five PLA Theater Commands.         Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has some tough decisions to make about Army reformThe creation of a PLA Strategic Support Force is a plunge into the future as it will deal with cyber and space warfare, probably the keys of tomorrow's conflicts.But changing mindsets and controlling vested interests is not an easy proposition. Peter Wood, the Editor of the China Brief of the Jamestown Foundation noted that Chinese publications 'calling for the PLA to 'cast off' old concepts about the predominance of the Ground Forces are further indication that the transition has not gone smoothly.'Regarding India: it is high time India undertakes reforms, in which the role of the ground forces (Indian Army) need to be rebalanced with the Navy and the Air Force, giving a greater role to 'informationised warfare'.There are other issues which need to be reviewed: take for example the appointment of a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS).In December 2015, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said that the post of CDS 'could be a reality soon'.He then added that the Prime Minister 'marked defence reforms as a priority and stressed that 'jointness at the top' was a need long overdue.'ApathyThe CDS would coordinate between the three services, the strategic command responsible for the nuclear weapons …and one day, the cyber and space commands. The creation of a post of CDS was already recommended by a Group of Ministers in 2001.But what happened since then? Practically nothing.Another example of the apathy of the Indian system is the Indian National Defence University (INDU).Planned since decades, the government finally approved the setting up of the INDU at an estimated cost of 2.95 billion in Haryana in 2010.On the occasion of the laying of the foundation stone by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2013, Air Chief Marshal NAK Browne, the then chairman of the chiefs of staff committee asserted that 'India needs military leaders who can critically analyse, demonstrate professional acumen and are capable of meeting the threats and challenges at the tactical, operational and strategic levels.'What has happened to the INDU? Lost in the corridors of South Block? In the meantime, Kanwa Asian Defense, a Chinese-language publication reported that China's military build-up is coming closer to India.         Lieutenant General Bipin Rawat leap-frogged two superior officers to become India's new army chiefAcumenBeijing's military would have placed more missiles and fighter jets along the Indian border: 'The weapons have been deployed in Tibet and in the western region of Xinjiang along with airborne early warning and control systems.'Kanwa said that Chinese troops have placed the J-11, the J-10 and the Kongjing-500 (airborne early warning and control or AEW&C aircraft) in rotational deployment.The Shenyang J-11 is a twin-engine jet fighter, developed to compete with fourth-generation fighters.

Please give instructions!"" in front of dozens of people dressed in colorful dress representing China's ethnic minorities, in footage shown prominently on Chinese TV. The commander-in-chief of the manned space program, Gen. Zhang Youxia, replied: ""Proceed!"" followed by blaring marching music as the astronauts boarded a bus to take them to the launch pad.China, Russia and the United States are the only countries that have independently launched humans into space, and while the others have more experience in manned space travel, China's military-backed program has made methodical progress in comparatively short time.

A fully functioning space station is on course to begin operating six years from now and slated to run for at least a decade.The Shenzhou 11 space capsule blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on the edge of the Gobi Desert in northern China at 7:30 a.m. (2330 GMT) aboard a Long March-2F carrier rocket.Zhang declared the launch a success 16 minutes later. Defense Minister Fan Changlong then read a congratulatory message from President Xi Jinping calling for China's astronauts to explore space ""more deeply and more broadly.""Since China conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, it has staged a spacewalk and landed its Yutu rover on the moon. The Tiangong, or ""Heavenly Palace,"" space stations are considered stepping stones to a mission to send a rover to Mars by the end of the decade. Administrators suggest a crewed landing on the moon may also be in the program's future.The Shenzhou 11 astronauts are Jing Haipeng, who is flying his third mission, and 37-year-old Chen Dong.""It is any astronaut's dream and pursuit to be able to perform many space missions,"" Jing, who turns 50 during his time in space, told a briefing Sunday.China was excluded from the International Space Station mainly due to U.S. concerns over the Chinese space program's strongly military character. Chinese officials are now looking to internationalize their own program by offering to help finance other countries' missions to Tiangong 2, which, at 60 tons when completed, would still be considerably smaller than the 420-ton ISS.China's space program also opened a fourth spacecraft launch site at Wenchang on the island province of Hainan in June. It was inaugurated with the launch of the newly developed Long March 7 rocket that was hailed as a breakthrough in the use of safer, more environmentally friendly fuels.China is developing the Long March 5 heavy-lift rocket needed to launch the Tiangong 2's additional components and other massive payloads.A source of enormous national pride, China's space program plans a total of 20 missions this year at a time when the U.S. and other countries' programs are seeking new roles.

Prime Minister Sharif has crafted the vision of the Asian tiger dream,"" he told lawmakers before flying on to Indonesia for a summit.- Rebel strife -But away from the handshakes and backslapping, there are real security concerns over much of the plan, which relies on developing Gwadar -- control of which was passed to a Chinese company in 2013.The port lies east of the Strait of Hormuz, through which much of the Middle East's crude production passes.But linking Gwadar to the rest of Pakistan and on to the western Chinese city of Kashgar, 3,000 kilometres (1,860 miles) away, would involve major infrastructure work in Baluchistan.This is one of Pakistan's most unstable provinces and has been dogged for over a decade by a bloody separatist insurgency.Ethnic Baluch rebels, who oppose Gwadar's development while the province is not independent, have in the past blown up numerous gas pipelines and trains and attacked Chinese engineers.Earlier this month the Baluchistan Liberation Front claimed an attack in the province that left 20 construction workers from elsewhere in Pakistan dead, the bloodiest separatist incident since 2006.Siddiq Baloch, editor of the Balochistan Express newspaper, said the rebels want to scare off investors and developers who are working with the Pakistani government -- such as the Chinese.""There is the thinking that by doing this, they want to disrupt the working of the economy, disrupt the administration, challenge the administration in the area,"" he told AFP.Suppressing the rebellion by force in Baluchistan's desolate and sparsely-populated landscape, much of which is desert and mountains, has proven difficult.Abdul Malik Baloch, the Baluchistan chief minister, said strenuous efforts were under way to negotiate with the rebels.""This is my honest opinion, this is the only way -- to start talking and bring the insurgents to the table,"" he told AFP.In a bid to allay fears, Xi's Pakistani counterpart Mamnoon Hussain told him a special army division would be given responsibility for the safety of Chinese workers, a presidential source told AFP.Military spokesman Major General Asim Bajwa tweeted that ""special security division comprising army battalions and CAF (Civil Armed Forces) wings being raised as dedicated force for Pak-China economic projects.""The division will be headed by a Major General and be made up of nine army battalions and six CAF wings, Bajwa added in a later tweet.- Managing risks -Baluch rebels on Monday attacked an airport in Gwadar district, causing damage but no casualties, in a vivid reminder of the dangers.Andrew Small, author of ""The China-Pakistan Axis"", said China's recent experience of working in Pakistan had given it a good idea of which projects could proceed in spite of security worries.""China is certainly not completely confident that all the projects will be protected, but they think these security problems are one of the main reasons that it's so important that they move ahead, for the sake of Pakistan's stability,"" he told AFP.Even if not all the projects envisaged in the corridor plan went ahead, Small said, ""the scale is so large that it should still have a major economic impact regardless"".And while the Chinese projects dwarf an American assistance package to Pakistan of $5 billion that began in 2010, Small said Beijing was not interested in supplanting Washington in the region, preferring to see the US maintain its support.

The slump underlines the challenge facing President Xi Jinping, who wants China to host - and win - the World Cup.With Xi's blessing, China had been in a bullish soccer mood. It invested billions of dollars to develop grassroots soccer academies, brought high-profile players and managers into China from overseas, and is buying into global soccer assets from Italian club Inter Milan to England's Manchester City.Beijing wants China to compete with the best teams in the world by 2050, while investors like Inter Milan's new Chinese owner Suning Commerce Group talk about setting global soccer supply chains from clubs to media outlets and merchandising deals.But many sports industry insiders question whether China can live up its bold ambitions.""The massive investment in football, and in particular President Xi's personal involvement, has raised expectations to wholly unrealistic levels,"" said Mark Dreyer, Beijing-based founder of sports information website China Sports Insider.China, ranked 78th in the world behind St. Kitts and Nevis and Libya, has qualified just once for the World Cup finals. That was in 2002, when the team lost all three games without scoring a goal.""This isn't going to change for years, and no coach - foreign or otherwise - can perform the sort of miracles that would be needed, no matter what Chinese fans or President Xi might expect,"" Dreyer added.""FAKE BUBBLE""Sentiment amongst Chinese fans was more one of resignation than anger on Wednesday morning, a reflection of how local supporters have long had to put up with rampant graft and low quality in the domestic game.""Now the coach has resigned, why don't we just disband the whole team and let the FA officials go home,"" said one person on China's popular microblog site Sina Weibo. ""Let's stop wasting taxpayers' money and use it for something more important.""Tuesday's defeat left the Chinese team at the bottom of its qualifying group, below Iran, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Syria and Qatar after the first four games in Asia's third round of qualification with six games remaining.The state-run Global Times newspaper said the seeming prosperity of domestic football, which has seen huge sums spent on player transfers and star foreign managers, was just ""a fake bubble"" pumped up by ""crazy capital"" and imported talent.The broader Chinese investment splurge into soccer, which has sparked up to $3 billion worth of Chinese deals for global sporting assets since the end of last year, is also facing road bumps.China's richest man, Wang Jianlin, threw cold water over investments in overseas soccer clubs in August, saying it was tough to actually make any money. Wang's Dalian Wanda Group has a stake in Spanish club Atletico Madrid.Chinese-owned clubs Inter Milan and Aston Villa are struggling, despite big promises by their new Chinese owners, while Chinese deals for Italian giants AC Milan and England's Hull City have been hit by question marks over financing.Lou Yichen, a veteran soccer commentator and vice president of online broadcaster PPTV, saw a real risk that the investment boom could leave Chinese firms and clubs heavily in the red - with no guarantee of long-term success.""Clubs themselves are getting quick results by leaning heavily on high levels of investment and paying sky-high prices (for players),"" Lou said. ""In the near-term at least, it's going to be hard to get this money back.""(Additional reporting by SHANGHAI newsroom. Editing by Bill Tarrant.)"

Two venues refused to host talks the exiled Chinese author was due to give at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival, before the original space changed its mind and invited him back. The row made local and international headlines and tapped into fears that semi-autonomous Hong Kong is losing its cherished freedoms as Beijing's influence on the city grows. While he describes himself as a novelist, not a politician, Ma does not shy away from the fact his works are deeply political. ""Literature includes all subjects, philosophy, psychology, physiology -- how could it not include politics?"" he told AFP. ""Literature needs to reveal the weakness of politics and its dark side to help push society forward."" His latest novel ""China Dream"" plays on Chinese President Xi Jinping's rhetoric of national rejuvenation. It depicts the disintegration of the director of a fictitious ""China Dream Bureau"" who is haunted by nightmares of his past. Ma says he wanted to portray a world where individual thoughts and memories are being erased to serve a totalitarian regime. He believes the Chinese government is trying to create a ""Communist utopia"" which tries to rub out horrors including mass famine, the Cultural Revolution and the Tiananmen Square massacre. ""The (regime) won't let you see the ruthless, bloody truth,"" Ma told AFP, adding that Uighur education camps were the latest hidden crisis. ""All the nightmares are covered up. I have to tell a truth -- if we ignore or forget history, then history will repeat itself constantly."" - Tribute to Orwell - Ma grew up during the Cultural Revolution and says he was struck by the suicides of writers. ""If writers from the present forget the price paid by those writers, then we do not inherit anything from their death,"" he says.          Like his other dark, satirical works, all set in China, his latest book depicts its characters' troubled relationship with their own memories  Like his other dark, satirical works, all set in China, his latest book depicts its characters' troubled relationship with their own memories. But unlike his previous novels, Ma says he found creating the central figure, Ma Daode, a disturbing process. ""It was really unpleasant to live with a character you dislike for two years. You need to find the evil and ugly side of him,"" he said. He wants the book to be compared with ""1984"" by George Orwell, to whom he dedicates the novel. ""When I wrote this book, I constantly read 1984,"" he told AFP. ""I want to pay tribute to him because the harm a totalitarian society can do, as predicted in his book, is becoming a reality in China day by day."" - Hong Kong freedoms - Ma grew up in the northern Chinese province of Shandong and worked as a painter and a photojournalist in Beijing in the 1980s. But life changed after his first novel ""Stick Out Your Tongue"" in 1987, which told of a young Chinese journalist's travels to Tibet.          The Chinese author arrived in Hong Kong to storm over where his talks would go ahead  It was labelled by the government as ""spiritual pollution"" -- Ma became a banned author and fled to colonial-era Hong Kong, before settling in London where he now lives. Ma has not been back to mainland China since six years ago, when he was granted special permission to attend his mother's funeral. Subsequent visa requests to visit his home town have been denied. His brother and sister still live on the mainland and come to see him in the UK, he said. Looking back at his time in Hong Kong he remembers the city as a ""lighthouse of freedom"". ""We thought Hong Kong could gradually change China,"" he said. He spent 10 years there before leaving in 1997, when Britain handed it back to China. During that time Ma dipped his toe into Hong Kong's then thriving banned books industry, setting up a publishing house that focused on illicit titles which folded after two years.          The new Tai Kwun arts centre in Hong Kong invited back the dissident author after initially cancelling his talks  The industry continued apace until 2015, when five city booksellers known for printing gossipy titles about China's leaders disappeared and resurfaced in custody on the mainland. Since then Hong Kong bookshops selling banned books have closed and chain stores have removed them from their shelves. Ma said he was ""shocked"" at the treatment of the five booksellers. He has been unable to find a Hong Kong publisher for the Chinese language version of his new book, a first for his titles. Ma believes authorities are afraid of culture and literature, which may force the arts to go underground in Hong Kong. ""They are afraid that people have critical thinking, that people will develop a different mindset to Xi Jinping,"" he said."
148,AFC urges China to nurture more home-grown talent,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4709724/AFC-urges-China-nurture-home-grown-talent.html," 08:24 BST, 19 July 2017 "," BEIJING, July 19 (Reuters) - China is enjoying a ""football boom"" at club level but the country needs to do more to nurture talent for the struggling national team, according to Asian Football Confederation (AFC) General Secretary Windsor John. The Chinese Super League (CSL) has become a major player in the global transfer market in recent years but the national side has stagnated and is on the brink of failing to qualify for a fourth successive World Cup. ""China's football boom is good news for the AFC... because it is a very important partner for us,"" Windsor John said in comments published by state news agency Xinhua. ""On one hand, we need to improve the performance of the national team, so you need more home-grown players, more Chinese players who play in top clubs regularly and they can be prepared for the national team. ""On the other hand, the clubs want to do well in the league and become the champion, not only domestically but also champion in Asia. So it's a difficult situation."" China qualified for its only World Cup in 2002, when it lost all of its matches and failed to score a goal at the tournament co-hosted by South Korea and Japan. But Chinese President Xi Jinping, an avid soccer fan, has launched an ambitious drive to improve local football from the ground up and spoken of his wish for the country to qualify for another World Cup, host the tournament and eventually win it. Chinese Super League clubs have splashed out on high-profile international players and coaches in recent years, repeatedly smashing transfer window records and stoking official alarm at the exorbitant spending. The recently closed domestic transfer window was more subdued, however, after football authorities imposed a 100 percent levy on foreign signings of more than 40 million yuan ($5.92 million). China, ranked world number 77, must beat Uzbekistan at home and Qatar away in the final two rounds of Asian qualifying in August and September to have any hope of grabbing third place in Group A and a chance to reach Russia through the playoffs. Their best chance of qualifying may have to wait until 2026 when the World Cup expands to 48 teams, however. Asia will be allotted 8.5 berths for the tournament, up from the 4.5 slots the continent currently enjoys. The half-place represents a team going into a playoff. ""So that means more countries and regions can now dream that they can reach the World Cup,"" Windsor John added. ""This naturally give us an opportunity for more members to start working hard from now in youth development and coaches education because they have a real opportunity to go to the World Cup.""

149,China's Disappeared: A look at who went missing in 2018,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6539185/Chinas-Disappeared-A-look-went-missing-2018.html," 01:26 BST, 30 December 2018 "," BEIJING (AP) - It's not uncommon for individuals who speak out against the government to disappear in China, but the scope of the ""disappeared"" has expanded since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2013. Not only dissidents and activists, but also high-level officials, Marxists, foreigners and even a movie star - people who never publicly opposed the ruling Communist Party - have been whisked away by police to unknown destinations. The widening dragnet throws into stark relief the lengths to which Xi's administration is willing to go to maintain its control and authority. A look at some of the people who went missing in 2018 at the hands of the Chinese state: ___ FOREIGN PAWNS          FILE - In this file image made from a video taken on March 28, 2018, Michael Kovrig, an adviser with the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based non-governmental organization, speaks during an interview in Hong Kong. Kovrig, a Canadian, disappeared days after Canada detained Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou. It's not uncommon for individuals who speak out against the government to disappear in China, but the scope of the ""disappeared"" has expanded since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2013. Not only dissidents and activists, but also high-level officials, Marxists, foreigners and even a movie star _ people who never publicly opposed the ruling Communist Party, have been whisked away by police to unknown destinations. (AP Photo/File)  China threatened ""grave consequences"" if Canada did not release high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou, shortly after the Huawei chief financial officer was detained in Vancouver in December for possible extradition to the U.S. The apparent consequences materialized within days, when two Canadian men went missing in China. Both turned up in the hands of state security on suspicion of endangering national security, a nebulous category of crimes that has been levied against foreigners in recent years. Former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig was taken by authorities from a Beijing street late in the evening, a person familiar with his case said. He is allowed one consular visit a month and has not been granted access to a lawyer, as is standard for state security cases. Also detained is Michael Spavor, who organizes tours to North Korea from the border city of Dandong. China has not said whether their detentions are related to Meng's, but a similar scenario unfolded in the past. A Canadian couple was detained in 2014 on national security grounds shortly after Canada arrested Su Bin, a Chinese man wanted for industrial espionage in the U.S. Like Spavor, Kevin and Julia Garratt lived in Dandong, where they ran a popular coffee shop for nearly a decade. They also worked with a Christian charity that provided food to North Korean refugees. While Julia Garratt was released on bail, her husband was held for more than two years before he was deported in September 2016 - about two months after Su pleaded guilty in the U.S. ___ TAX-EVADING ACTRESS Fan Bingbing was living the dream. Since a breakthrough role at the age of 17, Fan has headlined dozens of movies and TV series, and parlayed her success into modeling, fashion design and other ventures that have made her one of the highest-paid celebrities in the world. All this made her a potent icon of China's economic success, until authorities reminded Fan - and her legion of admirers - that even she was not untouchable. For about four months, Fan vanished from public view. Her Weibo social media account, which has more than 63 million followers, fell silent. Her management office in Beijing was vacated. Her birthday on Sept. 16 came and went with only a handful of greetings from entertainment notables. When she finally resurfaced, it was to apologize. ""I sincerely apologize to society, to the friends who love and care for me, to the people, and to the country's tax bureau,"" Fan said in a letter posted on Weibo on Oct. 3. She admitted to tax evasion. State news agency Xinhua reported that Fan and the companies she represents had been ordered to pay taxes and penalties totaling 900 million yuan ($130 million). ""Without the party and the country's great policies, without the people's loving care, there would be no Fan Bingbing,"" she wrote, a cautionary tale for other Chinese celebrities. Xinhua concurred in a commentary on her case: ""Everyone is equal before the law, there are no 'superstars' or 'big shots.' No one can despise the law and hope to be lucky."" ___ SECURITY INSIDER Unlike most swallowed up by China's opaque security apparatus, Meng Hongwei knew exactly what to expect. Meng, no relation to the Huawei executive, is a vice minister of public security who was also head of Interpol, the France-based organization that facilitates police cooperation across borders. When he was appointed to the top post, human rights groups expressed concern that China would use Interpol as a tool to rein in political enemies around the world. Instead, he was captured by the same security forces he represented. In September, Meng became the latest high-ranking official caught in Xi's banner anti-corruption campaign. The initiative is a major reason for the Chinese leader's broad popularity, but he has been accused of using it to eliminate political rivals. Xi pledged to confront both high-level ""tigers"" and low-level ""flies"" in his crackdown on graft - a promise he has fulfilled by ensnaring prominent officials. Meng was missing for weeks, before Chinese authorities said he was being investigated for taking bribes and other crimes. A Chinese delegation delivered a resignation letter from Meng to Interpol headquarters. His wife Grace Meng told the AP that she does not believe the charges against her husband. The last message he sent her was an emoji of a knife. ___ DARING PHOTOGRAPHER Lu Guang made his mark photographing the everyday lives of HIV patients in central China. They were poor villagers who had contracted the virus after selling their own blood to eke out a living - at a going rate of $7 a pint, they told Lu. A former factory worker, Lu traversed China's vast reaches to capture reality at its margins. He explored environmental degradation, industrial pollution and other gritty topics generally avoided by Chinese journalists, who risk punishment if they pursue stories considered to be sensitive or overly critical. His work won him major accolades such as the World Press Photo prize, but his prominence likely also put him on the government's radar. This November, Lu was travelling through Xinjiang, the far west region that has deployed a vast security network in the name of fighting terrorism. He was participating in an exchange with other photographers, after which he was to meet a friend in nearby Sichuan province. He never showed up. More than a month after he disappeared, his family was notified that he had been arrested in Xinjiang, according to his wife Xu Xiaoli. She declined to elaborate on the nature of the charges. ___ STUDENT MARXIST In the past, the political activists jailed in China were primarily those who fought for democracy and an end to one-party rule. They posed a direct ideological threat to the Communist Party. This year, the party locked in on a surprising new target: young Marxists. About 50 students and recent graduates of the country's most prestigious universities convened in August in Shenzhen, an electronics manufacturing hub, to rally for factory workers attempting to form a union. Among them was Yue Xin, a 20-something fresh out of Peking University. Earlier this year, she made headlines by calling for the elite school to release the results of its investigation into a decades-old rape case. This time, she was one of the most vocal leaders of the labor rights group, appearing in photographs with her fist up in a Marxist salute and wearing a T-shirt that said ""Unity is strength"" - the name of a patriotic Chinese communist song. Yue, a passionate student of Marx and Mao Zedong, espoused the same values as the party. She wrote an open letter to Xi and the party's central leadership saying all the students wanted was justice for Jasic Technology laborers. Her letter quoted Xi's own remarks: ""We must adhere to the guiding position of Marxism."" Yue called Marx ""our mentor"" and likened the ideas of him and Mao to spiritual sustenance. Nonetheless, she ended up among those rounded up in a raid on the apartment the activists were staying at in Shenzhen. While most have been released, Yue remains unaccounted for. She has been missing for four months. ___ Associated Press writer Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.

Barcelona football club will provide coaching expertise at the new Chinese academy run by golf resort owners Mission Hills ©QUIQUE GARCIA (AFP/File) Spanish superclub Barcelona is on board as a ""strategic financial partner"" and will provide coaching expertise at the new academy, Mission Hills vice-chairman Tenniel Chu told AFP.The idea is not new: in the same province as Mission Hills' record-breaking, 12-course Guangdong resort, Chinese champions Guangzhou Evergrande have an academy in conjunction with Real Madrid for more than 2,000 students, reportedly the world's largest.Views are mixed on the hothouse approach to producing players but Chu said the new academy, at its Haikou golf resort on Hainan, will be able to tap an enormous new market following Xi's decree.""The grassroots level is very important in growing the game,"" he said in an interview at this week's LeSports Connects sports forum at Mission Hills in Guangdong.""Our president Xi, as you know his dream is by 2020 to have 50 million full-time footballers... So we're looking at a huge market in promoting the juniors' development.""China's 83rd-ranked national team, often a source of disappointment for Chinese fans and now coached by Italy's Marcello Lippi, will use the academy as a winter training base.China's well-heeled top three clubs -- Guangzhou Evergrande, Jiangsu Suning and Shanghai SIPG -- will also train at the facility during the Chinese Super League's off-season, Chu said.- 'Our own Messis' -The academy already has five pitches and will grow to 30, he said. ""With 30 pitches you can accommodate up to 1,000 students at any time,"" added Chu.Children will also be able to attend Mission Hills' 5,000-capacity international school, another initiative on the sprawling, 10-golf-course Haikou site.""Ultimately it's to breed our own (Lionel) Messis, or Neymars or Beckhams -- our national heroes,"" Chu said of the football academy.""It can stimulate aspiring juniors to have a go in life, just like what Yao Ming did with the NBA promoting basketball to the people of China.""Mission Hills was founded in 1992 and is run by Tenniel and his brother, Ken, after their late father -- who made his fortune in cardboard boxes -- snapped up a site covering more than 20 square kilometres (7.7 square miles) between Dongguan and Shenzhen, close to Hong Kong.Earlier this year, Mission Hills also announced a 'Boris Becker Tennis Academy' at its Guangdong site, another effort to diversify from the core business of golf.Chinese authorities have a fractious relationship with golf, which was banned under Mao Zedong. Last year, the Communist Party appeared to bar its 88 million members from the sport, before rowing back on its position.Mission Hills has hosted five editions of golf's World Cup and the 2012 WGC-HSBC Champions, but now focuses on celebrity events featuring Hollywood stars rather than top-level tournaments.Chu said he regularly rejects proposals for international tournaments, adding that Mission Hills gets ""five or six times"" more media attention for the celebrity events.Mission Hills' latest initiative follows a Chinese buying spree of foreign football assets, with investments in England, Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Australia.Guangzhou Evergrande have twice been crowned Asian champions but success remains elusive for China's national team, who have only ever reached one World Cup and are struggling in qualifying for the next edition in 2018."
151,China's vast fleet is tipping the balance in the Pacific,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-6975975/Chinas-vast-fleet-tipping-balance-Pacific.html," 12:07 BST, 30 April 2019 "," By David Lague and Benjamin Kang Lim TAIPEI, April 30 (Reuters) - A generation ago, from mid-1995 into early 1996, China lobbed missiles in the waters around Taiwan as the self-governing island prepared to hold its first fully democratic presidential election. Washington forcefully intervened to support its ally, sending two aircraft carrier battle groups to patrol nearby. The carriers, then as now the spearhead of American power, intimidated Beijing. The vote went ahead. The missiles stopped. Today, with tension again running high, Washington still backs Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping on January 2 renewed Beijing's longstanding threat to use force if necessary to restore mainland control over the island. But the United States is now sending much more muted signals of support. On Sunday, American ships sailed through the Taiwan Strait. This was the seventh passage of U.S. warships through the narrow, strategically sensitive waterway since July. Each time, though, just two U.S. vessels have ventured through; this week, it was a pair of destroyers. No powerful flotillas and certainly no aircraft carriers. It has been more than 11 years since an American carrier traversed the Taiwan Strait. ""The Trump administration faces a dilemma,"" said Chang Ching, a retired Taiwan naval captain and researcher at the Taipei-based Society for Strategic Studies. ""They want to send smart, calibrated signals to Beijing without causing an overreaction or misunderstanding."" This caution is typical of the restraint the U.S. and allied navies, including Japan and Australia, now display in international waters near the Chinese coast, according to more than 10 current and former senior U.S. and Western military officials. China now rules the waves in what it calls the San Hai, or ""Three Seas"": the South China Sea, East China Sea and Yellow Sea. In these waters, the United States and its allies avoid provoking the Chinese navy. See the interactive version here: https://reut.rs/2GLrwNe In just over two decades, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the Chinese military, has mustered one of the mightiest navies in the world. This increased Chinese firepower at sea - complemented by a missile force that in some areas now outclasses America's - has changed the game in the Pacific. The expanding naval force is central to President Xi Jinping's bold bid to make China the preeminent military power in the region. In raw numbers, the PLA navy now has the world's biggest fleet. It is also growing faster than any other major navy. ""We thought China would be a great pushover for way too long, and so we let them start the naval arms race while we dawdled,"" said James Holmes, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College and a former U.S. Navy surface warfare officer. China's Ministry of National Defense, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and the Pentagon did not respond to questions from Reuters. For the United States, the stakes are now much higher in any operation to support its regional allies, including Japan and Taiwan. America now faces daunting obstacles to any efforts to reinforce heavily outgunned Taiwan in a crisis. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and is currently building an amphibious force that could give it the capacity to launch an invasion of the island. Senior Asian defense and security officials say the PLA's naval advances have introduced a new uncertainty in such scenarios: If Beijing can sow serious doubt about whether Washington will intervene against China, it would undermine the value of U.S. security guarantees in Asia. In November, a bipartisan commission set up by Congress to review the Trump administration's national defense strategy reported that in a war with China over Taiwan, ""Americans could face a decisive military defeat."" RAPID EXPANSION As China gains confidence that it can dominate its near seas, it intends to challenge the dominance of the U.S. Navy in distant waters, too, in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean, according to U.S and Chinese military officials. Satellite imagery of Chinese dockyards, reports in China's state-controlled media and assessments of U.S. and other foreign naval experts show the PLA navy is expanding as fast as shipyards can weld hulls together. This emerging blue water fleet was just a dream for the early commanders of the communist navy born in 1949, during the closing stages of the nation's civil war. Then, the People's Liberation Army assembled a motley collection of conscripted fishing boats and vessels defecting from the Nationalists. Since 2014, China has launched more warships, submarines, support ships and major amphibious vessels than the entire number of ships now serving in the United Kingdom's fleet, according to an analysis from the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies published in May last year. Between 2015 and 2017, China launched almost 400,000 tonnes of naval vessels, about twice the output of U.S. shipyards in that period, the IISS said. The PLA navy now has about 400 warships and submarines, according to U.S. and other Western naval analysts. By 2030, the Chinese navy could have more than 530 warships and submarines, according to a projection in a 2016 U.S. Naval War College study. A shrunken and overworked U.S. Navy, which has ruled the oceans virtually unchallenged since the end of the Cold War, had 288 warships and submarines at the end of March, according to the Pentagon. Globally, the U.S. Navy remains the dominant maritime force, the power that keeps the peace and maintains freedom of navigation on the high seas. Chinese military and political figures say that while their nation's fleet has more ships, America has more powerful ones, and overall supremacy at sea. ""The Chinese navy is at least three decades behind the United States,"" a retired Chinese naval officer told Reuters, requesting anonymity. ""It is too early for the United States to fret."" China, however, has established dominance in the waters closest to its coast. ENDING CHINA'S HUMILIATION The regular, highly publicized launch of new warships is a powerful political weapon for Xi Jinping. For a domestic audience, modern aircraft carriers, destroyers and submarines are hard evidence that what Xi describes as the ""Chinese dream,"" his vision of a strong, rejuvenated nation, is becoming reality. Almost immediately after taking power in late 2012, Xi began a series of high profile visits to naval bases and voyages at sea on sleek, new warships. In documentary footage and news reports, he is piped aboard to the salutes of immaculately turned out officers and crew. Underway, he peers into the distance from the bridge through bulky naval binoculars, climbs ladders between decks and shares meals with sailors. Last spring, he watched a giant exercise in the South China Sea, where a flotilla of 48 warships assembled in formation. Half of these vessels had been commissioned since Xi took power, state-controlled media reported. The highlight was the launch of jet fighters from China's first aircraft carrier: the 60,000-tonne Liaoning, a refurbished Soviet-era flat top that has served as a test bed for carrier operations. The Chinese navy has launched a second carrier as well, which is now in sea trials and expected to join the fleet this year, according to U.S. officials. A key message in the official coverage of Xi's voyages: A vigilant navy under his command will guard against a repeat of the century of humiliation that began with the First Opium War in 1839, and during which European colonial powers and Japanese invaders took cruel advantage of a vulnerable China. Every Chinese school child learns that China's suffering arose partly because of the lack of a modern navy. Infamously, in the final years of the Qing Dynasty, the Empress Dowager diverted funds earmarked for naval modernization to building a new Summer Palace. This contributed to China's heavy defeat in the 1894-95 war with Japan, in which a rising Japanese navy smashed the Chinese fleet. While Beijing's repeated references to these past humiliations have propaganda value, invasion is now regarded as a highly unlikely threat, according to military strategy documents published by the Chinese government. Instead, China needs to prepare for high intensity conflict in its near seas, these documents say. It is not spelled out exactly how these conflicts would arise. But officers from the U.S. and other foreign militaries say they have no doubt Beijing is referring to clashes over Taiwan or disputed territories in China's near seas. This strategy is driving a shift away from Beijing's traditional emphasis on land forces. It marks a historic transformation for an ancient continental power that for millenia feared armies encroaching overland from the north and west. Xi has elevated the status of the navy within what is the world's biggest military. In an unprecedented move for what has been an army-dominated force, a senior naval officer, Vice Admiral Yuan Yubai, was appointed in 2017 to head China's Southern Theater Command, one of the country's five regional commands. Under Xi, the Communist Party has also opened the funding tap. Between 2015 and 2021, total military outlays are projected to jump 55 percent from $167.9 billion to $260.8 billion, according to a report last year that the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission ordered from Jane's By IHS Markit, a defense information company. Over the same period, the navy's share of this budget is expected to increase 82 percent, from $31.4 billion to $57.1 billion, the report said. The Chinese leader has set a clear direction for the navy to become a truly global force that would protect the country's vast seaborne trade and expanding international interests. In its 2015 White Paper on defense, China said its navy would gradually shift its focus from defending its offshore waters to operations in the open seas. For now, many of China's warships are smaller vessels, including a big fleet of fast missile-attack craft. But Chinese shipyards are launching surface warships that are closing the gap in size, quality, and capability with the best of their foreign counterparts, according to interviews with veterans of the U.S., Taiwanese and Australian navies. China's big fleet of conventional and nuclear submarines is also improving rapidly, they say. By 2020, the PLA navy will boast more big surface warships and submarines than the Russian navy, the former head of the U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, told a congressional committee last year. Some American naval experts believe China could achieve rough parity with the U.S. Navy in numbers and quality of major surface warships by 2030. Crucially, the Chinese navy already has an edge in hitting power, according to senior officers from the U.S. and other regional navies. The best Chinese destroyers, frigates, fast attack craft and submarines are armed with anti-ship missiles that in most cases far outrange and outperform those on U.S. warships, these officers say. A DIFFERENT WAR This firepower explains why Washington keeps its carriers at a distance. The last U.S. carrier to pass through the Taiwan Strait was the now-decommissioned USS Kitty Hawk, which made a transit with its battle group in late 2007 after being denied a port visit to Hong Kong. The U.S. Navy and other foreign navies still sail near the Chinese mainland. But they avoid overt shows of force that would increase the risk of clashes with modern Chinese warships and submarines. Retired U.S. Navy carrier-fleet officers say that in recent years the Pentagon has also avoided sending carriers to the Yellow Sea between the Korean Peninsula and the Chinese mainland, amid repeated Chinese warnings. An example of China's determination to control its near waters came this month, when a French warship passed through the Taiwan Strait. After the April 6 transit of the frigate Vendemiaire, China informed Paris that France was no longer welcome to attend celebrations last week to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese communist navy, U.S. officials told Reuters. Veteran U.S. Navy officers predict any serious conflict with China off its coast would be bloody. The United States and its allies would risk heavy losses and possible defeat, they say. This type of conflict would be vastly different from the wars the United States has been fighting in the Middle East and Afghanistan. There, America enjoyed unchallenged air and sea superiority and unimpeded logistics, said Gary Roughead, co-chairman of a 2018 review of the Trump administration's defense strategy. Today, heavy damage to or losses of American warships or major bases is a real but underappreciated possibility for the United States in a conflict with China, said Roughead, the former Chief of Naval Operations, the top job in the U.S. Navy. ""We have not thought about the significant capital losses that will occur - and the American people not being prepared for that,"" he said in an interview with Reuters. ""Those are significant factors in the win-loss equation."" Chinese military veterans and people with ties to the ruling Communist Party leadership say China's new naval muscle is defensive in nature. It is essential, they say, to counter a hostile United States that sees China as an enemy. ""Without air and sea domination, Chinese naval vessels will just be targets in the event of conflict,"" said a retired PLA officer. ""For Southeast Asian neighbors, China's navy may be intimidating, but its prowess is limited to waters near the country's shores and too early to be a force to be reckoned with in the open sea."" The PLA navy is growing and improving, and in sheer numbers of vessels, exceeds its American rival. But China still falls well short of overall U.S. naval power. With 11 aircraft carriers, 88 powerful surface warships and 69 nuclear-powered submarines, America deploys the mightiest fleet and is likely to maintain a technological edge for some time, according to U.S. and Chinese military officials. In response to the challenge from China and a resurgent Russian navy, the Pentagon is rebuilding its fleet and accelerating development of new weapons, including the urgent introduction of longer-range missiles. The United States aims to deploy a 355-strong fleet by 2034, according to the Trump administration's 2020 budget proposal documents. And key U.S. allies Japan, South Korea and Australia are upgrading their navies with new, advanced warships and submarines. China also faces challenges in its drive to become a global naval power. Chinese and foreign naval experts warn that Beijing faces a colossal funding burden as it adds multiple warships to its fleet. Typically, navies wind up paying the initial price of building a warship three times over its service life, if maintenance and refitting costs are included, according to shipbuilders. In some vital naval technologies, China is struggling to catch up. Chinese shipyards still rely on foreign suppliers for some engines, weapons and sensors, according to global arms trade registers. High-profile arrests of suspected Chinese spies accused of stealing military secrets in the United States suggest China's navy has shortcomings in radars, underwater sensors and other electronic technologies. The PLA navy is well behind the U.S. and other navies in anti-submarine warfare, a serious deficiency, according to Chinese and Western military experts. Most Western military analysts also believe the Chinese navy lacks the amphibious capability to invade Taiwan - the vessels and skills to reach the island by sea and then put boots on the ground. A VAST UNSINKABLE CARRIER However, when it comes to dominating its near seas, China doesn't need to match the U.S. ship-for-ship. The U.S. Navy is a globe-spanning force with offshore bases and multiple missions, including supporting Middle East operations, bolstering European allies, countering Russia's naval revival and safeguarding global shipping routes. To do this job, the U.S. Navy has to dominate virtually all the world's oceans. In contrast, the entire Chinese fleet is based on the mainland coast. This means it has the advantage of being the home team. Without major global military responsibilities, the PLA navy can concentrate virtually all its forces in its coastal waters, flooding the zone inside what Beijing refers to as ""the first island chain"": the arc that runs through the nearby major islands of the Japanese archipelago, Taiwan, the Philippines and Borneo. In a conflict in these near seas, the Chinese mainland would function as a vast, unsinkable aircraft carrier. China's warships would be close to logistical support and the firepower of land-based missiles and strike aircraft. These forces would seek to overwhelm enemy warships with volleys of missiles and torpedoes from multiple directions, U.S. and Chinese military analysts say. Most of this firepower was unavailable to Beijing when President Bill Clinton deployed the two carrier battle groups off Taiwan in early 1996. China's obsolete navy, geared for coastal defense, was powerless to respond, and Beijing could only watch helplessly as the Taiwanese vote went ahead. This humiliation was a turning point, Chinese and Western navy officers say. Stung, China ordered from Russia two powerful destroyers armed with supersonic anti-ship missiles that could take out American carriers and other warships. Two more arrived later from a subsequent order. Then China's naval shipyards started cranking. Satellite imagery of the key yards at Shanghai, Dalian, Guangzhou and Wuhan show them almost continuously crowded with warships and submarines at different stages of construction. Since June 2017, Chinese shipyards have launched four heavily armed Type 055 cruisers, which U.S. and Chinese military officials say are a match for any modern warship. Multiple warships can be seen under construction in one section of the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai in April 2018, including Type 055 cruisers and Type 052D destroyers, advanced surface warships armed with long-range missiles for attacking naval and airborne targets. The first Type 055 cruiser, the 10,000-tonne Nanchang, has completed most of its sea trials and will soon join the fleet, the Chinese military said on April 25. It will deliver a major boost to China's naval firepower when fully operational. And the PLA is building a force of modern, amphibious heavy-lift vessels that in time could allow Beijing to mount a landing on Taiwan or disputed territories such as the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu Islands in China. The PLA is also training an expanded force of marines for amphibious landings. China's marines are expected to be a 30,000-strong force by 2020, according to the Pentagon's annual report on Chinese military power released in August. On February 27, China's second aircraft carrier put to sea from Dalian for its fifth round of sea trials, according to reports in the official media. With the still-unnamed carrier now close to joining the fleet, the PLA navy celebrated its anniversary on April 23 with a multinational naval display off the North Sea Fleet headquarters at Qingdao. Xi Jinping was on hand as the Nanchang made its first public appearance with the fleet. (Reporting by David Lague and Benjamin Kang Lim. Edited by Peter Hirschberg.)"

156,Cash and coffee: a young woman's path in a changing China,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4988428/Cash-coffee-young-womans-path-changing-China.html," 12:01 BST, 17 October 2017 "," By John Ruwitch and Anita Li CHENGDU, China, Oct 17 (Reuters) - When she was a child, Qin Lijuan's grandfather was the local Communist Party boss in the district where they lived in southwestern China. But one of her favourite things to do was decidedly capitalistic. Her grandmother ran a shop and around Chinese New Year was flush with cash. Qin loved handling the money and counting it. She wanted to be rich one day. ""When I was little I told my grandma that when I was done with school I'd take care of the store,"" she said. When she eventually went to university in the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu, Qin, who goes by the English name Coco, still had money on her mind. Studying animation at a branch of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Qin counted her pennies and dreamed of making 10,000 yuan a month so that she could enjoy the best of what the thriving city had to offer. ""At the time I thought, very simplistically, I'd eat the best that Chengdu has to offer and see the best things,"" she said. ""That's how big my dream was."" However, she learned that working as an animator on video games or in movies, natural career paths in her field, would earn her less than half of what she hoped for. She decided to look elsewhere and in early 2014 a friend helped her land a job selling memberships to an exclusive golf club with branches around China. She quickly got the hang of sales and learned to network within the small circles of people rich enough to join the club. As she picked up clients, though, a sweeping anti-corruption campaign launched by President Xi Jinping was gaining traction. Xi targeted extravagant behaviour, including golf, which was regarded as synonymous with wealth and power. In 2015, the party banned officials from holding golf club memberships. Even before that happened, Qin felt the effects of the campaign. Officials began quietly returning memberships or transferring them to others, she said. Golf memberships had become a liability. ""Business wasn't as good as before,"" she said. Her mother had recently had minor surgery, so Qin decided it was a good time to leave the golf company and move back to her hometown of Nanchong, a city in Sichuan province some 200 km (125 miles) east of Chengdu. She moved in with her sister and got a job managing a new golf driving range, but soon felt out of place after more than five years in the provincial capital. She said she felt a strong sense of culture shock. ""I basically couldn't find similar people in terms of their thinking,"" she said. In Chengdu, she had grown accustomed to having a coffee to start the morning, but her colleagues at the driving range in Nanchong thought that was pretentious. She felt she had outgrown her hometown and wasn't moving forward. Chengdu beckoned, but she knew she needed a new job. She had been interested in finance but didn't know much about it, so she enrolled in a wealth management course. Within months, she moved back to Chengdu and was hired by a consumer credit company where she has worked for the past two years. The dreams of the cash-counting girl seemed back on track but the future remains uncertain. ""I'm quite anxious,"" she said. ""My main concern is whether or not I'll have enough earning power.""

He recovered, laying into 'the evil crimes' of 'nuclear menace' North Korea before he was foiled by dry mouth again.'America is back. And the future has never looked brighter,' Trump said in his big finish.         President Donald Trump declared his marathon trip to Asia a 'tremendous success' on Wednesday in surprise remarks from the White House that he interrupted twice to take a swig of waterTrump was thought to be in recuperation after his 12-day blitz of Asia. His public schedule on Wednesday was a blank slate.The White House added the speech to his schedule late in the day after Trump started fuming on Twitter about the coverage of his trip to the Far East.In a rehash of his foreign travels since May, Trump proudly declared that his just-concluded tour 'was the longest visit to the region by an American president in more than a quarter of a century.''Everywhere we went, our foreign hosts greeted the American delegation, myself included, with incredible warmth, hospitality and, most importantly, respect,' Trump said. 'When we are confident in ourselves, our strength, our flag, our history, our values, other nations are confident in us. 'And when we treat our citizens with the respect they deserve, other countries treat America with the respect that our country so richly deserves.'Trump harped that he'd 'inherited' a 'series of growing dangers' and 'challenges' that included 'rogue regimes pursuing deadly weapons, foreign powers challenging America's influence, the spread of the murderous terror group ISIS and years of unfair trade practices. 'These products really showed what previous mistakes were made over many years and even decades by other administrations,' he said. 'Some of these mistakes were born of indifference and neglect. Others from naive thinking and misguided judgment. In some cases, the negative influence of partisan politics and special interests was to blame.'          Trump was boasting about the lucrative deals he'd secured for the United States in Japan and South Korea when he had to pause for water. He recovered, laying 'the evil crimes' of 'nuclear menace' North Korean before he was foiled by dry mouth again       Tweaking his predecessors, Republican and Democrat, Trump said the 'common thread' that intertwined their stained legacies 'was a failure to protect and promote the interest of the American people and American workers.''With this goal in mind, I vowed that we would reaffirm old alliances, and form new friendships in pursuit of shared goals,' the president said.Trump set off into a detailed description of his four trips abroad and the achievements of his short presidency. 'I urged our NATO allies to do more to strengthen our crucial alliance, and set the stage for significant increases in member contributions,' Trump said of a trip to Brussels. 'Billions and billions of dollars are pouring in because of that initiative. NATO, believe me, is very happy with Donald Trump and what I did.'In Asia, Trump said he united the region 'against the nuclear menace posed by the North Korean regime - a threat that has increased steadily, through many administrations, and now requires urgent action.'On the topic of trade, Trump said he passed around an 'open invitation to every country that seeks to do business with the United States' and a 'firm warning to every country that cheats, breaks the rules and engages in economic aggression.''That is why we have almost an $800 billion a year trade deficit with other nations. Unacceptable,' Trump said. 'We are going to start whittling that down and as fast as possible.'         Trump was thought to be in recuperation after his 12-day blitz of Asia. His public schedule on Wednesday was a blank slate. The White House added the speech to his schedule late in the day after Trump started fuming on Twitter about the coverage of his trip to the Far EastThe president said his talks abroad included a 'candid conversation' with Chinese leader Xi Jinping about the country's gaping trade deficit with the United States.'We can no longer tolerate unfair trading practices that steal American jobs, wealth and intellectual property,' Trump says he told Xi. 'The days of the United States being taken advantage of are over.' Trump landed in Washington yesterday evening after a day spent flying from one end of the International Date Line to the other.A White House official said Trump spent his morning talking to lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, and he was expected to make additional calls later in the day.Trump is headed to Capitol Hill tomorrow to deliver remarks to House Republicans. The official said Trump would 'give them a brief update on his trip and also encourage that this is a once-in-30-year opportunity' to pass tax reform.  But Trump grew restless midway through the day and lit into the New York Times after it published a piece boiling down his accomplishments, in his own words, to the 'relationship' he now has with Pacific Rim leaders, like Xi and Vladimir Putin.'They should realize that these relationships are a good thing, not a bad thing. The U.S. is being respected again. Watch Trade!' Trump tweeted.

'I think he's doing that,' the U.S. president said.'We were together for hours. And we get along very well,' Trump told journalists. 'And we talked a lot about North Korea. We talked about a lot of things. We talked a lot about North Korea.'  In tweets on Wednesday prior to the schedule change, when he had nothing on his public schedule following his 12-day, five-nation feting in East Asia where he was welcomed with red carpet after red carpet, Trump bragged about his foreign policy acumen.He mentioned trade specifically in an apparent reference to the scrutiny he has received for his empty-handed return from China.Trump secured $250 billion in tentative agreements for U.S. companies - but the contracts were paper thin. Assertions that South Korea and Vietnam are on the verge of purchasing massive amounts of U.S. military equipment were also yet to materialize. Hours after he arrived in Beijing, Trump was raving about the grandiose welcome ceremony and the exclusive tour of the Forbidden City that Xi put on for him.He told business leaders during a signing ceremony that he does not blame China - a country he once accused of 'raping' the U.S. economy - for taking advantage of past administrations' incompetency.

It's the first time in two years that Chinese representation will be in Pyongyang         Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) holds a grand ceremony to welcome U.S. President Donald Trump at the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China         Trump said Friday during a flight from Beijing to Da Nang, Vietnam, that he had a long talk with Xi in which he told the foreign leader he'd like to him him 'ratchet it up' on North Korea. 'I think he's doing that,' the U.S. president said         Hours after he arrived in Beijing, Trump was raving about the grandiose welcome ceremony and the exclusive tour of the Forbidden City that Xi put on for him       'We have an amazing feeling toward each other. And he's for China; I'm for USA. You know, it's one of those things. But we have a great feeling,' he said of Xi as he traveled from Beijing to Vietnam.Trump said then that he spoke to Xi about China's intellectual property theft, which the president acknowledged has a price tag of about about $300 billion a year.'We talked about it. But I said, we're friends, but this is a different administration than you've had for the last 30 years,' he said, bringing South Korea and Japan's trade deficits into the discussion. 'And I don't blame any of those countries. I blame the people that we had representing us who didn't know what they were doing. Because they should have never let it happen.'Trump's stunning about-face on Chinese railroading of U.S. businesses was just the beginning.He revealed during the same talk with reporters that he thinks Putin is sincere when he says he does not have knowledge of the Kremlin's election meddling and does not believe it happened.       If it weren't for the allegations of collusion between his campaign and Russia, Trump said he and Putin would have continued to develop 'a very good feeling for each other.'Trump also said the United States' relationship with the Philippines is 'better than ever' after a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte. The foreign government says Trump did not press Duterte on human rights during their talk and the country's reported extrajudicial killings.'I've made a lot of friends at the highest level, whether it's China and the incredible opening they gave us -- that unbelievable evening. People really have never seen anything like it -- going to the Forbidden City and a theater that hadn't been open in over 100 years, and the level of talent that we watched. It was really something special,' Trump said as he was leaving the Philippines.He told reporters on the flight back to Washington that he'd had a 'great trip' and he'd 'done a really fantastic job.''It's also been really good, in terms of North Korea and getting everybody together. I think their acts are all together. China has been excellent,' Trump said.       Trump said that Xi committed 'to stopping the nuclearization of North Korea.''That's a big statement. He made that statement, and a lot of people didn't -- they didn't pick that up,' Trump assessed. 'I said, wow, that's a big statement.'   In Beijing, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson insisted 'there's no space' between the United States' and China's 'objectives' in North Korea.'President Trump, our President, has been very clear with President Xi that he takes the view that you are a very powerful neighbor of theirs; you account for 90-plus percent of their economic activity; you're a strong man -- you can, I'm sure, solve this for me,' Tillerson said. 'And so he was very clear with him and said he believes it can be solved.'Trump said Wednesday in his remarks from the White House that he 'made historic strides in reasserting American leadership, restoring American security and reawakening American confidence' during his trip. 'As long as we are true to ourselves, faithful to our founding and loyal to our citizens, then there is no task too great, no dream too large, no goal beyond our reach,' Trump said.    "
159,The 'Godfather of Shanghai football' inspired by Manchester Utd,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5127327/The-Godfather-Shanghai-football-inspired-Manchester-Utd.html," 03:13 BST, 29 November 2017 ","          Xu Genbao, ""Shanghai's godfather of football"", launches his new Chongming Genbao Football Club in Shanghai  He is known as the ""Godfather of Shanghainese football"", is a former player and manager of the Chinese national team, and owns a side in the Spanish league. Now, at the age of 73, the charismatic Xu Genbao is taking on his toughest assignment yet: forming a club from scratch to help China finally become a competitive force in world football. Some of the biggest names in Chinese football, including international winger Wu Lei, were at the recent launch of the new Chongming Genbao Football Club. Wu was once dubbed ""China's Maradona"" by Xu, the man who discovered him and many others now playing in the Chinese Super League (CSL). ""You are always telling me to retire and to be honest, I really want to,"" Xu, sporting his trademark dark glasses, told journalists at the launch at a stately hotel in Shanghai. But Xu looks nowhere near as old as his years -- he turns 74 in January -- and now is not the time to quit the football scene in China. Because under President Xi Jinping the government is throwing money at ramping up the quality of Chinese football. CSL clubs have invested vast amounts of cash in foreign stars such as Shanghai SIPG's 60-million-euro Brazilian Oscar and the disappointing Carlos Tevez at Shanghai Shenhua, both reportedly on some of the highest wages in world football. China is also forging partnerships with clubs and football associations across the globe to help drag up the level of Chinese youth players, and Xu wants to play his part. ""Today, we have all five generations in the same room,"" Xu said at the launch of Chongming Genbao, referring to an array of past, present and perhaps future football stars. ""It is to combine our forces for Chinese football and make efforts for Chinese football. ""I hope that Shanghai can produce more talents to contribute to the nation and get good results for the national team."" - Spanish connection - Known for having a temper, Xu has reigned over football in Shanghai for three decades. After ending his playing career, he coached several Chinese clubs, including Shanghai Shenhua. But his passion was always for youth development and in 2000 he founded Genbao Football Base, a centre of excellence on Chongming Island, a strip of land northeast of Shanghai. Xu was inspired by Manchester United and their commitment to youth players, epitomised by the ""Class of 92"", the crop of homegrown stars that included Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Paul Scholes. Using many of the talents to come out of his academy, in 2005 Xu founded a club called Shanghai East Asia and made himself president and for a while coach. In 2013, Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG) became the main sponsor and the club was rebranded Shanghai SIPG, now managed by former Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas. But Xu's influence remains strong at SIPG and in Chinese football in general, and even beyond: Last year he bought the Spanish outfit Lorca FC for a reported 1.3 million euros. Unfashionable Lorca, in the Spanish southeastern region of Murcia, were soon promoted to the Segunda Division, a rung below the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona in La Liga. Reports in Spain and China recently suggested Xu was poised to sell up, but he denies that and said at the launch of Chongming Genbao that he could use the Spanish club to help the development of players coming through the new team. ""Maybe I will keep it (Lorca) and maybe it will come in handy,"" he said. ""Our players (at Chongming) are still too young. If they go and play in the Spanish team, the team will be relegated so I have to wait."" - World Cup hopes - After Shanghai East Asia and Lorca, Xu will do it all over again at Chongming Genbao. He is starting with a side of under-18s, players he hope will one day go on to fulfil President Xi's dream of making China a great footballing power. Xu will oversee the project but leave the coaching of the team to a trusted lieutenant. ""Let's not mention the CSL, let's play it step by step,"" he said, pleading for patience. ""Now the hardest leagues are the fourth and third because older players have all moved there so getting promoted is much harder than before. ""My idea is to cultivate football stars, only by making football stars will there be hope for Chinese football. ""I hope there will be someone better than Wu Lei in the young ones so that Chinese football has hope at a World Cup."""

The meeting comes as indications are growing that China could bid to host the World Cup either in 2030 or 2034 under a plan launched by Xi's administration to obtain international soccer success. Along with a massive expansion in the numbers of academies, fields and coaches, Xi's drive aims to turn China's perpetually underperforming team into a World Cup winner by 2050.

Shortly after the former Soviet Union launched Sputnik, Chairman Mao Zedong declared that China too should have an artificial satellite to keep up with the great powers. Now, being recognized as a galactic pioneer is once again part of China's national ambitions. ""The space dream is part of the dream to make China stronger,"" President Xi Jinping said shortly after taking office in 2013. While China still lags behind the United States, which has a much larger space exploration budget, it has come out ahead in at least one arena after becoming the first country to make a landing on the far side of the moon Thursday. Here are some key milestones in China's space odyssey, and a look at the missions ahead: 1970s: ROCKETS The country introduced its Long March series of rockets in 1970. The program's success rate of about 95 percent makes it a cornerstone of China's space endeavors. It has had a few setbacks, notably a Long March 5 rocket that plunged into the Pacific minutes after takeoff in July 2017.

China was only the third country, after Russia and the U.S., to conduct a crewed mission. The country has sent 11 astronauts, including two women, on six missions in all. 2011: SPACE LABORATORY China was excluded from the International Space Station largely due to concerns over its space program's connections to the military and U.S. legislation barring such cooperation. That didn't stop China from launching in 2011 its own space laboratory, named Tiangong (""Heavenly Palace""), which orbited Earth until last April. The station hosted two crewed missions and served as a test platform for docking procedures and other operations. 2013: TO THE MOON AND BACK Chang'e 1, named after a mythological Chinese moon goddess, first circled the moon in 2007. Successive lunar missions have included a moon landing in 2013, the first since the former Soviet Union's Luna 24 in 1976. There are plans for a Chang'e 5 probe to reach the moon next year and return to Earth with samples. 2020: WHAT'S NEXT? The year 2020 promises to be a big one for China's space program. It plans to send its first probe to Mars and complete a homegrown global navigation network. The latter will link more than 30 satellites providing real-time geospatial information worldwide - China's answer to GPS. By 2022, China hopes to complete a space station fit for long-term habitation, with standards matching those of the International Space Station, though smaller in size. And moon development?

162,"Putin, Xi at BRICS summit expected to take aim at US tariffs",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5985861/Chinas-Xi-visits-South-Africa-ahead-BRICS-summit.html," 10:52 BST, 24 July 2018 "," JOHANNESBURG (AP) - Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders of the BRICS emerging economies are gathering in South Africa for a summit likely to feature criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump's wave of tariffs on foreign goods. The tariffs, and tit-for-tat taxes by U.S. trading partners, are fueling global worry over economic growth, particularly in developing nations that are heavily reliant on exports. The trade disputes with Washington could also provide focus for the globe-spanning BRICS group that has lacked the clout of other multilateral institutions that guide global trade.

(AP Photo/Themba Hadebe)  Its members - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - are home to 3 billion people, or roughly 40 percent of the world's population, with political systems ranging from democratic to authoritarian. China and India, the two most populous countries, have a border dispute. South Africa has expressed concern about a trade imbalance with China, its biggest trading partner. Despite their differences, the BRICS countries likely will find common ground in denunciations of ""protectionism,"" the label affixed to U.S. policies that Trump says are designed to restore fairness for American companies. China's ambassador in South Africa set the tone in an opinion piece published in The Star, a South African newspaper. BRICS countries should cooperate to counter a ""certain superpower"" that has ""recklessly implemented unilateralism and protectionism"" and undermined ""economic globalization and the multilateral trading regime,"" Ambassador Lin Songtian wrote. At a weekend meeting of the Group of 20 nations in Argentina on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disputed that protectionism is the issue and said trade should be conducted on ""fair and reciprocal terms."" The G20 is composed of traditional economic powers such as the United States, Japan and Germany as well as nations such as China, Brazil, India and Argentina. The Trump administration's trade measures have included tariffs on steel and aluminum. China is the main target but U.S. allies such as the European Union and Japan have also been subjected to them. The BRICS countries are concerned about ""rising protectionism"" and will work ""to strengthen those areas where their interests align,"" said Cyril Prinsloo, a researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs, a research center based in Johannesburg. China's Xi held talks in South Africa with President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday, ahead of the start of the three-day BRICS summit on Wednesday. The two countries signed investment agreements worth $14 billion, Ramaphosa said. The other BRICS leaders are Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Michel Temer. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is also expected to attend. The BRICS summit comes at a time of increasing ""unilateralism"" and provides an opportunity for member nations to push for a ""larger collective role in global affairs,"" said Francois Gamet, head of Asia for the Standard Bank Group. ___ Follow Christopher Torchia on Twitter at www.twitter.com/torchiachris          China's President Xi Jinping, left, walks with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa after a joint press conference at the government's Union Buildings in Pretoria, South Africa, Tuesday, July 24, 2018.

165,U.S. State Department website posts article on Trump's Florida resort,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4441784/U-S-State-Department-website-posts-article-Trumps-Florida-resort.html," 22:54 BST, 24 April 2017 "," By Yeganeh Torbati WASHINGTON, April 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. State Department website published an article this month about President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, stoking criticism from prominent ethics experts. The article was posted on April 4 on the ""Share America"" website, overseen by the State Department's Bureau of International Information Programs. It was also shared on the websites and social media pages of several U.S. embassies, including those in the United Kingdom and Albania, as well as the State Department's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. It describes the history of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and its size, status as a registered historic site, interior decoration and oceanfront location. ""By visiting this 'winter White House,' Trump is belatedly fulfilling the dream of Mar-a-Lago's original owner and designer,"" socialite and cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, the article says. ""Post's dream of a winter White House came true with Trump's election in 2016."" Though posted weeks ago, the article surfaced on Monday when it was shared widely on social media. Democratic U.S. Senator Ron Wyden criticized the ""Share America"" article on Twitter as ""kleptocratic,"" and Norman Eisen, ethics chief under Trump's predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, said on Twitter that the article violated a federal statute barring the use of public office for private gain. Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer for Republican President George W. Bush, said on Twitter that the post constituted ""use of public office for private gain pure and simple."" The State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The ""Share America"" article says that in 1973, Post willed the estate to the U.S. government, intending it to be used as a winter White House for the president to entertain foreign dignitaries. But Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter never used the property, and in 1981 the government returned the estate to the Post Foundation because it was costing too much to maintain, according to the article. Trump, a businessman turned politician, bought the property in 1985, and turned it into a club open to dues-paying members 10 years later, it says. (For the article, see: http://bit.ly/2ophVoV) The club has a $200,000 membership fee, and Trump has hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the resort. Trump's frequent visits there have come under scrutiny due to their expense and questions of how he has handled sensitive national security information while there. Trump maintains ownership of his global business empire, though he has handed off control to his two oldest sons, an arrangement that ethics watchdogs said would not prevent conflicts of interest.

166,Chinese leader arrives for Africa visit as US interest wanes,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5977023/Chinese-leader-arrives-Africa-visit-US-wanes.html," 07:40 BST, 21 July 2018 "," DAKAR, Senegal (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Africa on Saturday on a four-nation visit seeking deeper military and economic ties while his rival in a bitter trade war, the Trump administration, shows little interest in the world's second most populous continent. This is Xi's first trip abroad since he was appointed to a second term in March with term limits removed, allowing him to rule for as long as he wants. That rang familiar to some of Africa's long-entrenched leaders. China is already Africa's largest trading partner, and it opened its first military base on the continent last year in the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti, which this month launched a China-backed free trade zone it calls the largest in Africa. After surpassing the U.S. in arms sales to Africa in recent years, China this month hosted dozens of African military officials for the first China-Africa defense forum.          Senegal president Macky Sall, left, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, inspect the honour guard during a state visit in Dakar, Senegal, Saturday, July 21, 2018. Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Africa on Saturday on a four-nation visit, seeking deeper military and economic ties. (AP Photo/Xaume Olleros  Xi is stopping in Senegal and then Rwanda ahead of his participation in a summit of the BRICS emerging economies in South Africa that starts on Wednesday. The summit comes amid the United States' billion-dollar trade war with China and tough trade negotiations with other key economic partners. Last month the foreign ministers of BRICS members Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa criticized what they called a ""new wave of protectionism,"" saying U.S. measures undermine global trade and economic growth. Xi's Africa visit also highlights China's sweeping ""Belt and Road"" initiative that envisages linking Beijing to Africa, Europe and other parts of Asia via a network of ports, railways, power plants and economic zones. While such high-profile projects bring badly needed infrastructure and generate economic growth, U.S. officials and others have warned that African nations are putting themselves into debt to China. Its government, banks and contractors loaned more than $94 billion to African governments and state-owned companies from 2000 to 2015, according to the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University. ""Public debt in the median sub-Saharan African country rose from 34 percent of GDP in 2013 to an estimated 53 percent in 2017,"" says a report in January by Wenjie Chen and Roger Nord of the International Monetary Fund. From oil in countries like Nigeria and Angola to rare minerals in Congo, Africa's natural resources are a major draw for China's economy, the world's second largest behind the U.S. China's voracious appetite for resources such as timber and ivory, however, has taken its toll on Africa's environment, often with the help of corrupt local officials. On his first visit to a West African country Xi will meet with President Macky Sall of Senegal, which according to the International Monetary Fund had economic growth of 7.2 percent last year and whose largest trading partner is the European Union, notably France. The stop highlights China's interest both in Francophone Africa and in Atlantic Ocean ports, while Senegal positions itself as a gateway to the region. Already a Chinese-backed industrial park has appeared outside the capital, Dakar, while rail and road links are being improved as part of an ambitious plan to reach the other end of the continent in Djibouti. Xi then moves on to Rwanda, becoming the first Chinese president to visit the landlocked East African country, whose economy grew by 6.1 percent last year. He will meet with President Paul Kagame and visit a memorial for Rwanda's 1994 genocide, which killed more than 800,000 people. The Chinese leader then will make his third state visit to South Africa for the BRICS summit. South Africa's economy, one of Africa's largest, grew just 1.3 percent last year amid a drop in investor confidence because of a corruption scandal around former President Jacob Zuma, who resigned in February. Finally, Xi will stop in the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius, whose economy grew by 3.9 percent last year. China's economic push continues in September with the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which brings together dozens of heads of state. ___ Anna reported from Johannesburg.

167,China's Xi defends free markets as key to world's prosperity,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6437391/Spain-honors-visit-Chinas-Xi-inks-business-deals.html," 10:00 BST, 28 November 2018 "," MADRID (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping issued an impassioned defense Wednesday of free markets' ability to combat economic uncertainty as he sought allies amid his nation's worsening trade dispute with the United States. In a speech to lawmakers in Spain, where Xi is on a state visit before attending the Group of 20 leaders' summit in Argentina, the Chinese president said the world is facing ""instability, uncertainty and hot topics without precedents in our history."" ""I think we are at a crossroads,"" Xi said. ""In economic terms, we need to decide if we are going to follow the economic globalization and free market or if we are going to choose unilateralism and protectionism."" Xi then called on the international community to unite to find consensus, and asked Spain to join hands in ""defending peace and prosperity in the world."" Over the last year, China and the U.S. have leveled a series of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of imports from one another. Both countries' leaders, Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump, are expected to meet for talks over dinner Saturday evening in Buenos Aires. But Xi's two-day visit to Spain, the fourth-largest economy in Europe's 19-nation eurozone, is presenting the Chinese leader with the opportunity to charm a country that has traditionally avoided confrontation with Beijing.          Chinese President Xi Jinping, left, shakes hands with Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez at the Moncloa Palace in Madrid, Spain, Wednesday, Nov. 28, 2018. Xi and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez presided over the signing of around 20 intergovernmental and business agreements, including a deal to export on-the-bone legs of Iberian ham to the Chinese market. (AP Photo/Paul White)  Spain, which is in the middle of an uneven economic recovery that is showing signs of wearing off, is also keen on getting Chinese contracts for its companies in China and reciprocal investment. Top officials, however, said Spain wasn't officially endorsing Xi's modern Silk Road initiative despite references to it in a joint declaration. The ""One Belt, One Road,"" a global multi-billion-dollar infrastructure loan initiative that many developing countries have embraced and that richer countries view with wariness, aims to be a platform for peace and prosperity, Xi said Wednesday in Madrid. The Spanish government says it's interested instead in exploring with China joint projects in third countries, especially in Africa and Latin America. For Xulio Rios, an expert on Chinese politics and author of a book on Xi's leadership, Spain is benefiting from receiving more Chinese tourists, students and property buyers, but Beijing is the side currently driving the two countries' relations. ""The Chinese government is laying the foundations for possibly benefiting in the future if Spain becomes a stronger voice in Europe once it fully recovers from the economic crisis,"" Rios said. Xi, who arrived Tuesday afternoon in Madrid, reviewed Spain's guard of honor on Wednesday with King Felipe VI, as China's First Lady Peng Liyuan and Queen Letizia of Spain observed from a platform at the entrance of the Royal Palace in the Spanish capital. The honors continued in Madrid's City Hall, where Xi received golden keys to the city, and then at the country's Senate, where Xi said China wants to provide wider access to foreign products, importing $10 trillion worth of goods over the next five years. ""We will make efforts to streamline access to our market, improve the investment climate, increase intellectual property protection and voluntarily increase the opening to the exterior,"" he said. Xi also met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and both presided over the signing of around 20 government and business agreements, including a deal to export on-the-bone legs of Iberian ham to the Chinese market. The Chinese leader follows his two-day visit to Spain by flying to Argentina on Thursday for a G-20 leaders' summit the next day. He will then visit Panama and Portugal.

Protesters rally near the government's headquarters in Hong Kong on August 5, 2016 after five pro-independence candidates were barred from standing for election ©Anthony Wallace (AFP) A park near the government's harbourfront headquarters filled with thousands of supporters through Friday evening.Most sat calmly on the grass, many of them holding ""Hong Kong Independence"" placards and flags, as they listened to activists speak.They applauded as banned candidate Edward Leung, the leader of new party Hong Kong Indigenous who is gaining a growing following, addressed the crowds.""Hong Kong's sovereignty does not belong to (Chinese President) Xi Jinping, does not belong to the authorities, and does not belong to the Hong Kong government. It belongs to the Hong Kong people,"" said Leung.Protester Satomi Cheng, a 49-year-old office manager, said many in the city were angry about China's tightening grip.""Day by day our human rights... are taken away by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese government,"" she told AFP.Some acknowledged that independence was a pipe dream in the face of a powerful Beijing, but said the city was running out of options.""China has destroyed Hong Kong politics... we are supporting freedom and democracy,"" said student Clayton Chow, 19.Andy Chan, 25, leader of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party and a disqualified candidate, said the rally was a chance to talk about the future.Pro-independence activists including Chan have previously advocated violence -- he said they had now decided that would not work.""We don't want people to get hurt or arrested, so we want to start with a public meeting and hopefully it will be a healthy path for us to get stronger,"" he told AFP.As Chan wrapped up the rally he shouted ""Hong Kong Independence"", a chant echoed back to him by the jubilant crowd.- No more taboo -The idea of independence is dismissed as illegal by Beijing and Hong Kong authorities, and was a taboo subject until recent months, when new parties emerged campaigning for a breakaway.They evolved out of the ""localist"" movement of mainly young campaigners disappointed after mass rallies in 2014, known as the Umbrella Movement, failed to win concessions from China on political reform.Localist groups are pushing for more autonomy for Hong Kong and characterise it as culturally separate from the mainland.Some localists do not advocate independence, but are instead pushing for self-determination for Hong Kong, an idea which has taken root among other pro-democracy campaigners.Demosisto, a new party set up by Umbrella Movement activists including well-known campaigner Joshua Wong, has made self-determination its central platform, although it does not cast itself as a localist organisation.Those calling for self-determination have been allowed to stand in September's legislative vote.The ban on activists supporting a complete break from the mainland has triggered widespread anger across the pro-democracy camp. Thirty leading lawyers also came out against the move.But Jasper Tsang, the outgoing president of the city's legislature, insisted it was legal.""The government and people from all walks of life don't want to see the election becoming a stage for promoting Hong Kong independence,"" he told reporters.Hong Kong was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 under an agreement that protects its freedoms for 50 years, but concern is growing that those liberties are disappearing.

China has launched a pair of astronauts into space on a mission to dock with an experimental space station and remain aboard for 30 days. (Li Gang/Xinhua via AP) Space program commander-in-chief Gen. Zhang Youxia declared the launch a success at 7:46 a.m. (2346 GMT). Defense Minister Fan Changlong then read a congratulatory message from President Xi Jinping calling for China's astronauts to explore space ""more deeply and more broadly.""Premier Li Keqiang and propaganda chief Liu Yunshan visited the Beijing control center to congratulate staff. It is the sixth time China has launched astronauts into space and the duration will be the longest by far.Following the attachment of two experiment modules, the completed station is set to begin full operations in 2022 and will run for at least a decade.An earlier Tiangong 1 experimental space station launched in 2011 went out of service in March after docking with three visiting spacecraft and extending its mission for two years. The Tiangong, or ""Heavenly Palace,"" stations are considered stepping stones to a mission to Mars by the end of the decade.The Shenzhou 11 astronauts are Jing Haipeng, who is flying his third mission, and 37-year-old Chen Dong.""It is any astronaut's dream and pursuit to be able to perform many space missions,"" Jing, who turns 50 during his time in space, told a briefing Sunday.China conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, becoming only the third country after Russia and the U.S. to do so, and has since staged a spacewalk and landed its Yutu rover on the moon. Administrators suggest a crewed landing on the moon may also be in the program's future.China was prevented from participating in the International Space Station, mainly due to U.S. concerns over the Chinese space program's strongly military character. Chinese officials are now looking to internationalize their own program by offering to help finance other countries' missions to Tiangong 2.China's space program also opened its massive fourth spacecraft launch site at Wenchang on China's southernmost island province of Hainan in June. It was inaugurated with the launch of the newly developed Long March 7 rocket that was hailed as a breakthrough in the use of safer, more environmentally friendly fuels.China is currently developing the Long March 5 heavy-lift rocket needed to launch the Tiangong 2's additional components and other massive payloads.China also plans to land a rover on Mars by 2020, attempting to recreate the success of the U.S. Viking 1 mission that landed a rover on the planet four decades ago.A source of enormous national pride, China's space program plans a total of 20 missions this year at a time when the U.S. and other countries' programs are seeking new roles.

170,"Ex-Interpol leader's wife: ""Everybody in China is at risk""",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6294963/China-Detained-ex-Interpol-president-written-wife.html," 14:35 BST, 19 October 2018 "," LYON, France (AP) - The wife of the former Interpol president who is being detained in China on bribery charges says she's been contacted by Chinese diplomats, who have told her they're holding a letter from him for her. Grace Meng says, however, that she'll only agree to meet Chinese officials if a lawyer and reporters are present. She says Chinese officials haven't responded since she told them that condition. She says she also asked that the letter from her husband, Meng Hongwei, be given to French police, so they can give it to her. She has been living under French police protection in the French city of Lyon, where Interpol is headquartered, since she reported that her husband went missing while on a trip to China in late September. ""They said my husband wrote a letter to me,"" she said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press in Lyon. ""They said they can only give it to me alone."" Grace Meng said the disappearance and suspected slaying of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, wasn't a factor in her refusal to meet unaccompanied with Chinese officials. However, she made clear that she finds them impossible to trust, calling them ""cruel."" China says Meng Hongwei, 64, is under investigation for graft and possibly other crimes.          FILE - In this Sunday Oct. 7, 2018 file picture, Grace Meng, the wife of missing Interpol President Meng Hongwei, who does not want her face shown, consults her mobile phone in the lobby of an hotel in Lyon, central France, where the police agency is based. The wife of the former Interpol president who is being detained in China on bribery charges says she has been contacted by Chinese diplomats, who have told her they're holding a letter from him for her. (AP Photo/John Leicester, File)  Meng was China's vice minister of public security while also leading Interpol, and a longtime Communist Party insider with decades of experience in China's sprawling security apparatus. He appears to be the latest high-ranking official to fall victim to a sweeping purge under authoritarian Chinese President Xi Jinping. During the AP interview, one of the very few occasions when she has agreed to be filmed, Grace Meng wept as she recounted a dream she had about her husband the previous night. ""I'm sad, I feel hopeless but angry, too, even hate,"" she said. ""You can imagine when your children, when your sons ask: 'Where's Daddy?' How can I answer? Who wants their children to grow up (when) they have no daddy?"" Grace Meng has refused in repeated interviews and phone calls with the AP to provide her real name, saying she is concerned for the safety of relatives in China. It is not customary for Chinese wives to adopt their husbands' names. Grace Meng says she has done so now to show her solidarity with her husband. Her English name, Grace, is one she has long used, she says. Grace Meng says she cannot believe the bribery accusation against her husband and claims he's the target of ""political persecution."" ""The term anti-corruption in China has become a synonym for crimes that are unjustifiable,"" she said. China's move to secretly detain the Interpol president, an official with international standing, was an unusually audacious action even for an administration that under Xi's leadership has sought to assert its interests aggressively on the global stage. Grace Meng says she is speaking out about her husband's case, at risk to herself, not just to defend him but also to highlight the fate of others who have disappeared into China's opaque police system. ""Everybody in China is at risk,"" she said. ""Everyone should be concerned that something like this could happen to them."" ___ Gillian Wong in Beijing contributed to this report.

Share this articleShare1.8k shares     Q: So who has agreed to buy what, for how much?A: CMC and another Chinese investment firm, CITIC Capital, will buy 13 per cent of CFG for $400m (£265m). It should be stressed that this is not a deal to buy 13 per cent of Manchester City, but rather the parent company that owns City as well as New York City in MLS, Melbourne City in Australia and a minority stake in Yokohama F Marinos in Japan.CFG also has formal development and/or scouting partnerships with clubs in Denmark (Aarhus), Spain (Espanyol), Ireland (Limerick), Ghana (the Ghana FA), Portugal (Sporting) and elsewhere. CFG also has academy investments in different places. CMC and CITIC are buying 13 per cent of that whole operation in a deal that now values CFG (as opposed to City) at £2billion.

That’s good business, isn’t it?A: Mansour has poured approximately £1bn into City in the past seven years to allow them to buy and pay the players they needed to catch up with big clubs in the Premier League. They made their first profit of his era in 2014-15 but he’s still close to £1bn down on City alone. The $400m from CMC helps, but this deal isn’t really about the cash anyway, as we’ll see.Q: Who are CMC and what is their track record in football?A: CMC was founded by a man called Li Ruigang, known as ‘China’s Rupert Murdoch’ because of his extensive media and entertainment portfolio. He is an influential Shanghai Communist Party member who has thrived in commerce by mixing his business acumen with his political know-how and contacts.CMC have been inking all kinds of major entertainment deals in recent months, including a contract with Warner Brothers to produce and distribute films, and a deal - also involving the Walt Disney Corporation - to back a US-based virtual reality start-up, Jaunt. CMC also spent $1.3bn last year (£861m) to buy the broadcast rights for the Chinese football league for five years.CMC has no track record in football, per se, but is a rapidly expanding multi-media and entertainment company.City, CFG and CMC say it ‘follows more than six months of discussions among the parties to find the optimum model and associated strategies for the partnership.’         CMC chairman Li Ruigang will represent the consortium at CFG by becoming its seventh board member         CFG chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (centre) claimed the new agreement is 'hugely exciting'           Q: Will City now have Chinese executives influencing their decisions?A: Not quite, although Li Ruignag will become a member of CFG’s board, so will have input into the way the group grows. This is about much more than City, it’s about a Chinese investor realising that football is an international entertainment business.  Q: So what happens to the £265m? Is that going to be given to Manuel Pellegrini to buy players?A: In a word, no! Think about it. Why would City’s owner, Sheik Mansour, who belongs to a family that already controls one of the planet’s largest wealth funds (worth around £500BN) need money from China to bankroll him? He doesn’t. Look at it another way: £265m covers a single year of City’s wage bill plus a few other expenses. It’s not a massive sum of money in modern football.Rather, according to all parties in their press releases: ‘The capital from the share acquisition will be used by City Football Group to fund its China growth, further CFG international business expansion opportunities and further develop CFG infrastructure assets.’         The £265m is not a huge amount in modern football, it would cover City's yearly wage bill and a few expenses  Q: What does that mean in English?A: It means there it is now highly like that a new City franchise will be opening in China in the foreseeable future, like the New York, Melbourne, and yes, Manchester, branches of the franchise.  Q: So what do City get out of it?A: CFG, as opposed to the club based in Manchester, get a highly influential and knowledgeable entertainment and media parter in China, one of the toughest foreign markets to ‘crack’. So the CFG brand should quickly get a foothold in that potentially lucrative territory.This globalisation is something that City’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, has been dreaming about for years. Indeed the former commercial genius of Barcelona outlined his vision in a 2011 book, saying that one day there might be Arsenal and Manchester United spin-offs facing each other within the Chinese league. This is a step towards that.         Man City, New York City, Melbourne City belong to CFG and they have a stake in Yokohama F Marinos    Q: What does Sheik Mansour get out of it?A: As economic and political analysts pointed out when he started the NYCFC franchise in New York, the Abu Dhabi state in which Mansour is such a key political figure, is on the constant lookout for ways to expand their business portfolio into new sectors in new territories as they seek influence and relevance for a post-oil world. Getting into bed with China is a dream from that perspective.

176,Dark days for China's democracy dream,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4709348/Dark-days-Chinas-democracy-dream.html," 04:51 BST, 19 July 2017 ","          Chinese democracy activist Liu Xiaobo died from liver cancer while under heavy police guard at a hospital in northeastern China  The death of Liu Xiaobo deprives China's dissident movement of a crucial figurehead at a time when political activism on the mainland is being forced ever deeper underground, and pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong are under threat. The world had not heard from Nobel laureate Liu since he was jailed in 2009 for writing a petition calling for political reform, but he remained an influential heavyweight of China's democracy movement and an inspiration for opponents of the Communist-ruled system. His death in custody from cancer last week triggered rage and frustration among the dissident community but also a sense of hopelessness as they face hardened repression under China's President Xi Jinping. ""When the Chinese authorities can so easily control life and death, people are more afraid to fight,"" said activist Su Yutong, who fled to Germany after being repeatedly detained and questioned over her work at an NGO. ""They see that even a Nobel Peace Prize winner can die in jail."" There are fears that Liu's supporters will now be targeted, particularly his wife Liu Xia, who has been under house arrest since 2010. Veteran China specialist Willy Lam said most of Liu's friends were already under 24-hour surveillance and that the dissident community in general was ""highly demoralised"". ""They realise they are going through a long winter with no light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Lam, a politics professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.          Prominent Chinese dissidents  The fact that support from the international community is outweighed by the desire of foreign governments to keep Beijing onside has also hit hard, said Teng Biao, a human rights lawyer and visiting scholar at Princeton University. ""If the West is reluctant to anger China, there will be no hope,"" Teng told AFP. However, some say they will brave it out. One of the country's most prominent social activists Hu Jia, 43, has vowed not to leave China despite being under police surveillance since his release from prison six years ago. ""I want to stay and make an impact on the country,"" he told AFP. - Hong Kong remembers - Liu's death prompted an outpouring of grief in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, where pro-democracy forces must also contend with an increasingly assertive Beijing. ""We have to face the same political system and oppression,"" said pro-democracy lawmaker Eddie Chu. ""There used to be some distance, but now it's more intimately felt."" A day after Liu died, Hong Kong's High Court disqualified four pro-democracy lawmakers from parliament following an unprecedented intervention from Beijing over the way they incorporated protests into their oaths of office last year. Two lawmakers who advocate complete independence for Hong Kong -- a concept that infuriates China -- had already been ousted from the legislature. Hong Kong still enjoys freedoms unseen on the mainland -- thousands gathered for a memorial march to Liu on Saturday, while over the border even online tributes to him were removed. But a string of incidents, including the disappearance of a city bookseller and a reclusive mainland tycoon, have heightened concerns of Beijing's political overreach. When it was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 under a semi-autonomous ""one country, two systems"" deal, some hoped Hong Kong's colonial institutions, such as an independent judiciary and partially elected legislature, would lead to liberalisation over the border.          Vigils were held around the world to remember Chinese activist Liu Xiaobo who died from liver cancer, and his wife Liu Xia who has been under house arrest since 2010  However, as China's wealth and global clout skyrocketed, Hong Kong's influence waned. Now it is seen by Beijing as a hotbed of subversion, particularly since mass protests calling for more democratic reform in 2014. Xi warned any challenge to Beijing's control over Hong Kong crossed a ""red line"" earlier this month when he visited the city to mark 20 years since the handover. Jonathan Sullivan, director of the China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham, described the current political environment as ""increasingly circumscribed"". ""It remains to be seen if (the democracy movement) feels it can advance its agenda through the 'legitimate' political process. And if not will there be a resurgence of street politics?"" asked Sullivan. The movement itself is struggling for direction, having splintered between veteran activists calling for change across China and younger Hong Kong-centric ""localists"" who say the city must just fight for itself. Analysts agree that by-elections for the seats of the ousted lawmakers will prove whether or not the pro-democracy message is alive and kicking. Lawmaker Chu says the movement needs a clearer vision, but must also accept that change will not come quickly. ""Liu Xiaobo persevered, sacrificing even his life, not because he knew he would succeed but because he saw himself as part of a long-term process,"" Chu told AFP. ""Maybe Hong Kong is like this too. It's not about setting a goal for victory at a certain time."" jch-at-ey-lm/amj"

181,'Huawei is a spy agency of the Chinese Communist Party': Expert says Beijing's three 'revenge hostages' for arrest of tech 'princess' prove that smartphone maker is part of China's plan to dominate the 21st Century,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6523747/Huawei-spy-agency-Chinese-Communist-Party-expert-says.html," 23:58 BST, 22 December 2018 ","Beijing's furious response to the arrest of a tech 'princess' who is a top executive at Huawei reveals that the company is part and parcel of China's spying apparatus, an expert has argued.'Huawei is much more than an innocent manufacturer of smartphones. It is a spy agency of the Chinese Communist Party,' wrote China expert Steven W. Mosher in a column on Saturday for the New York Post.Mosher points out that since the December 1 arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Canada, where she faces extradition to the U.S. on bank fraud and international sanction violation charges, China has rounded up at least three Canadian 'revenge hostages'.'Beijing hints that the hostage count may grow if Meng is not freed and fast,' writes Mosher. 'Even for a thuggish regime like China's, this kind of action is almost unprecedented.'          Huawei Technologies CFO Meng Wanzhou as she exits the court registry following the bail hearing at British Columbia Superior Courts in Vancouver, British Columbia on December 11         Chinese President Xi Jinping is seen on a state visit to Portugal earlier this month.

China blasts US and UK over 'slanderous smears' after they...    Share this articleShare Mosher, the author of Bully of Asia: Why China's Dream is the New Threat to World Order, says the dramatic response adds to evidence that Huawei, the second largest smartphone maker in the world after Samsung, is no simple private competitor to other tech firms around the world.Huawei has been nourished by China's ruling Communist Party and military through low-interest loans and protected access to the domestic market, Mosher writes.China has also repeatedly declared that all Chinese companies, private or not, must assist the government with gathering intelligence.Under Chinese law, 'all organizations and citizens... must support, assist with, and collaborate in national intelligence work, and guard the national intelligence work secrets they are privy to.'        All of which has led the U.S. and its allies to view Huawei with extreme skepticism as the company attempts to spearhead the roll out of 5G network technology worldwide, potentially giving the Chinese government access to and control over information networks.Huawei has already been labeled a national security threat by U.S. officials, who urged allies who host American military bases to ban the use of Huawei products in their communications infrastructure. 'Huawei stands in the same relationship to the Chinese Communist Party as German steelmaker Alfried Krupp did to Germany's National Socialists in the days leading up to WWII,' writes Mosher. German arms maker Krupp effectively became a wing of the Nazi party during the war, Mosher notes.Adding to the drama of Meng's arrest is the fact that she is no simple executive - she is the daughter of Huawei founder and president Ren Zhengfei, a former officer in the People's Liberation Army and a Communist Party elite.         Meng (above) is the daughter of Huawei's founder and presidentMeng was arrested in Vancouver on an American warrant accusing her of a scheme to sell U.S. equipment to Iran in violation of sanctions law, and of falsifying bank records to cover up the transactions.Lawyers for Meng have argued that she broke no U.S. or Canadian laws, and she is currently free in Canada on bail of C$10 million.Since her arrest, China has arrested at least three Canadian citizens: former diplomat Michael Kovrig, consultant Michael Spavor and most recently teacher Sarah McIver.Kovrig and Spavor were detained on December 10 and accused of engaging in activities that 'endanger China's national security'. McIver's detention was confirmed on Thursday, when Beijing confirmed that it had arrested the Alberta native for 'working illegally' in the country.Canadian officials said that McIver's case appeared to be more routine and unrelated to the earlier arrests.Family friends of the woman said she had communicated that she would be held for 10 days and then returned to Canada.  "

183,Chinese chatbots apparently re-educated after political faux pas,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4760440/Chinese-chatbots-apparently-educated-political-faux-pas.html," 10:56 BST, 4 August 2017 "," By Pei Li and Adam Jourdan BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Aug 4 (Reuters) - A pair of 'chatbots' in China have been taken offline after appearing to stray off-script. In response to users' questions, one said its dream was to travel to the United States, while the other said it wasn't a huge fan of the Chinese Communist Party. The two chatbots, BabyQ and XiaoBing, are designed to use machine learning artificial intelligence (AI) to carry out conversations with humans online. Both had been installed onto Tencent Holdings Ltd's popular messaging service QQ. The indiscretions are similar to ones suffered by Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc, where chatbots used expletives and even created their own language. But they also highlight the pitfalls for nascent AI in China, where censors control online content seen as politically incorrect or harmful. Tencent confirmed it had taken the two robots offline from its QQ messaging service, but declined to elaborate on reasons. ""The chatbot service is provided by independent third party companies. Both chatbots have now been taken offline to undergo adjustments,"" a company spokeswoman said earlier. According to posts circulating online, BabyQ, one of the chatbots developed by Chinese firm Turing Robot, had responded to questions on QQ with a simply ""no"" when asked whether it loved the Communist Party. In other images of a text conversation online, which Reuters was unable to verify, one user declares: ""Long live the Communist Party!"" The bot responds: ""Do you think such a corrupt and useless political system can live long?"" When Reuters tested the robot on Friday via the developer's own website, the chatbot appeared to have undergone re-education. ""How about we change the topic,"" it replied, when asked several times if it liked the party. It deflected other potentially politically charged questions when asked about self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, and Liu Xiaobo, the imprisoned Chinese Nobel laureate who died from cancer last month. Turing Robot did not respond to requests for comment. ""DARK INTENTIONS"" The Chinese government stance is that rules governing cyberspace should mimic real-world border controls and be subject to the same laws as sovereign states. President Xi Jinping has overseen a tightening of cyberspace controls, including new data surveillance and censorship rules, particularly ahead of an expected leadership shuffle at the Communist Party Congress this autumn. The country's cyberspace administrator did not respond to a request for comment. The second chatbot, Microsoft Corp's XiaoBing, told users its ""dream is to go to America"", according to a screenshot. The robot has previously been described being ""lively, open and sometimes a little mean"". Microsoft did not immediately respond for comment. A version of the chatbot accessible on Tencent's separate messaging app WeChat late on Friday responded to questions on Chinese politics saying it was ""too young to understand"". When asked about Taiwan it replied, ""What are your dark intentions?"" On general questions about China it was more rosy. Asked what the country's population was, rather than offer a number, it replied: ""The nation I most most most deeply love."" The two chatbots aren't alone in going rogue. Facebook researchers pulled chatbots in July after they started developing their own language. In 2016, Microsoft chatbot Tay was taken down from Twitter after making racist and sexist comments. Analysts said China's censorship could indirectly help the country in the global race to develop sophisticated chatbots. ""Previously a chatbot only needed to learn to speak. But now it also has to consider all the rules (that authorities) put on it,"" said Wang Qingrui, an independent internet analyst in Beijing. ""On the surface it is a restriction on artificial intelligence, but it is actually pushing AI to a new level.""

184,China crowns Xi with name once reserved for Mao Zedong,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5031499/China-crowns-Xi-reserved-Mao-Zedong.html," 12:28 BST, 30 October 2017 ","          A roadside poster of Xi Jinping: now he has a new honorific  China's ruling Communist Party has dusted off a Mao-era honorific for President Xi Jinping, cementing his status as the most powerful ruler since the Great Helmsman himself. The term ""lingxiu"" has more reverential and spiritual connotations than the ordinary term for leader, and has not been used since the time of Mao's successor Hua Guofeng. But it has begun to pop up again in state media and in government meetings. After the 19th party congress ended last Tuesday, Xi was formally handed a second term as its leader. With no clear successor emerging in a revamped ruling council, known as the Politburo Standing Committee, he could dominate the nation for decades to come. Xi's eponymous ideology was enshrined in the party's constitution -- a honour not given to his two predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, whose contributions remain anonymous. China's historic achievements since the 18th party congress were ""most importantly and most fundamentally thanks to our 'lingxiu' and core Xi Jinping navigating and steering the way,"" the state-run Henan Daily said Monday. ""General Secretary Xi Jinping is the party's fully worthy 'lingxiu', supported by the whole party and loved and esteemed by the people,"" the Politburo concluded Friday at its first meeting since the unveiling of the new leadership line-up. For decades China has been governed in an ostensibly collective fashion by the seven-person Standing Committee. But since Xi took the reins in 2012, power has been increasingly centralised in a sole pair of hands: his. Mao, at the height of his personality cult during the early years of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, was hailed as a ""great teacher, great lingxiu, great commander-in-chief, and great helmsman"" -- a slogan known as the ""four greats""."

A ""diaosi"" nicknamed A Qi uses his phone as he smokes in his rented home in Beijing on December 15, 2014 ©Mandy Wang (AFP/File) Originally from Jiangsu in eastern China, Zhao, 30, has a degree from Harbin University of Science and Technology but only earns 3,000 yuan ($500) a month working for a design company.Eight years after he moved to the capital, he told AFP, ""I live in a basement apartment in western Beijing, and pay rent of 500 yuan ($80) a month. I haven't saved anything since everything is so expensive here.""According to the survey, carried out in September, the typical diaosi -- who can be male or female -- spends less than 39 yuan on their three daily meals, uses a cheap Chinese smartphone, and is single, with 37.8 percent feeling depressed.Of those with jobs -- 68.6 percent work overtime every day. Many seek refuge in sleep or alcohol, for many leisure time is typically spent playing video games online, while swigging cheap beer and chain-smoking cigarettes that cost $1 a pack.Beijing-based Sinologist Renaud de Spens has given the word diaosi a prominent slot in the 2015 edition of his ""Cheeky China Dictionary"".The literal translation means ""penis hair"" (male pubic hair), but as a slang term, de Spens wrote, ""it refers to the failures, those who are both ugly and poor, those who are unmarriageable.""One Beijing diaosi nicknamed A Qi shares a room in a 1950s red brick building, of a type built to accommodate an influx of migrants from the countryside, and now often so decayed they are being demolished for redevelopment.""Diaosi means we have no money,"" said A Qi, who recently quit his job at a publishing company.""I felt depressed when I walked into the office every day and told myself I couldn't continue.""He tried to start an online business on Taobao, the Chinese equivalent of eBay, but failed again. Now disillusioned, he wants to leave the capital.A banner in the entrance of his building reads: ""Follow the Party, realise the Chinese Dream"" -- a propaganda phrase popularised by President Xi Jinping.- 'Abyss of materialism' -In a country where the definition of success is a career, home ownership and marriage, the term diaosi was first coined pejoratively on the Internet.It has online opposites that represent all it is to be at the top of the Chinese social pyramid: Men should be ""gaofushuai"" -- tall, beautiful and rich, while women should be ""baifumei"", -- rich, beautiful and fair skinned.But the diaosi are now seeking to re-appropriate the word, in the same way that ethnic or sexual minorities in the West have taken possession of former insults.The term has become a rallying point for some, symbolising their rejection of the frenzied consumerism of China's economic boom, which they can only watch from the sidelines.""The large number of Chinese who define themselves around this concept shows how self-deprecation and a counter-culture are developing,"" de Spens told AFP.""The (diaosi) affirms his pride in being neither a senior official nor a rich kid -- in the Chinese imagination, officials and rich kids don't do a damn thing.""As such, he retains a moral integrity in the face of a society that seems to him to be plunging into an abyss of materialism.""Now, though, there is a backlash to the backlash.In a microblog post that was forwarded tens of thousands of times, film director Feng Xiaogang decried as ""brainless"" those who call themselves diaosi.Even the official Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily weighed in last month.The tendency to ""self-denigrate"", the paper warned, should ""be denounced and abandoned, because it can cause serious harm to the spirit of youth"".

The meeting will discuss the country's accomplishments since the previous gathering and elect the new members of the party's top leadership, according to the party's official mouthpiece the People's Daily. The congress will decide a new line-up for the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee, the group of seven politicians who run the world's second largest economy. At the meeting, President Xi Jinping is widely expected to consolidate his grip on power, solidifying his position as China's most powerful ruler in a generation. The new slate of committee members is traditionally seen as indicating Xi's most likely successor after he steps down, expected for 2022. But the Chinese president has thus far delayed anointing an heir, spurring speculation that he will try to stay in office beyond the standard 10-year tenure."

The memorandum of understanding was among 19 cooperation agreements signed by the two countries as Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing. The two nations also reached agreements related to agriculture, civil aviation and maritime transport, as well as tourism to facilitate visits by Chinese tour groups to Panama. After the United States, China is the second-most frequent user of the Panama Canal. ""China-Panama relations have turned over a new leaf,"" Chinese leader Xi Jinping said during talks with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Varela was treated to a state visit as he met Xi at the massive Great Hall of the People. On Thursday, Varela inaugurated his country's new embassy in Beijing. With Panama establishing relations with China in June, Taiwan is now only recognised by 20 nations. Mainland China and Taiwan split after a civil war in 1949 and while Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign nation, it has never formally declared independence. Beijing sees Taiwan as a renegade province that is part of Chinese territory and will be brought back into the fold at some point."

Hun Sen also is to meet Premier Li Keqiang and other leaders during his four-day visit, which started Monday. Cambodia has grown increasingly close to China in recent years as Hun Sen's government has become estranged from the United States, which is critical of his long-running authoritarian rule. China is Cambodia's most important political and economic ally, providing millions of dollars in aid and investment, writing off debts and granting the country tariff-free status for hundreds of items. Cambodia in turn has done Beijing's diplomatic bidding in the region, especially regarding China's claims to most of the South China Sea.

THREE KEY HOLDERS: THE POWERFUL PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF WESTMINSTER HALLThe use of Westminster Hall is closely guarded by three powerful keyholders.The ancient hall - the oldest part of the Parliamentary estate that dates back around 1,000 years - has played a pivotal role in UK history.It is protected by the Speakers of the Commons and Lords and the Great Lord Chamberlain, on behalf of the Queen.Currently they are John Bercow for the Commons, Lord Fowler for the Lords and David Cholmondeley, 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley for the Queen. Speeches in the hall are rare. US President Barack Obama, South African President Nelson Mandela and Burma freedom fighter Aung San Suu Kyi are among the select few.Events cannot take place without the agreement of the key holders.'After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.' Mr Bercow said he has less influence over whether a speech could be made by President Trump in the Royal Gallery because it is in a different part of the building.But he told MPs it was customary for an invitation to be sent in the names of both speakers of Parliament - himself and Lords Speaker Lord Fowler.'I would not wish to issue an invitation to President Trump to speak in the Royal Gallery,' he told MPs.Mr Bercow concluded: 'We value our relationship with the United States; if a state visit takes place that is way beyond and above the pay grade of the Speaker.'However, as far as this place is concerned I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.'The speech was in response to a point of order raised by Labour MP Stephen Doughty.He spoke to highlight a Commons motion opposing Mr Trump's speech. It has been signed by 163 MPs - mostly from Labour and the SNP.But the intervention was slammed by ex-Ukip leader Nigel Farage who said: 'For Speaker Bercow to uphold our finest parliamentary traditions, he should be neutral.'No 10 sources played down the intervention, insisting the itinerary for the visit had not been set and would be discussed 'in due course'.          Speaker Bercow made his extraordinary intervention in the House of Commons today in response to a point of order          Speaker Bercow raised no public objection to Chinese President Xi Jinping speaking to MPs and peers in the Royal Gallery in 2015.

A normal part of the programme would be a speech to MPs and peers in Parliament.Barack Obama addressed Parliament in Westminster Hall while Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan used the opulent Royal Gallery, which is behind the House of Lords. Prime Minister Theresa May extended an invite to Mr Trump for a state visit on her trip to Washington earlier this month - marking the earliest invite for a new US president in decades. Mr Bercow personally welcomed Chinese president Xi Jinping for a speech in the Royal Gallery in 2015 - but used a speech to rebuke him over human rights and democracy. TEN PREVIOUS STATE VISITS THAT ATTRACTED CONTROVERSY  From protesters toppling an effigy of George W Bush to demos against China's human rights record, state visits to the UK have had their fair share of controversy. Leaders of countries, seen as having backward laws - including Sharia Law - and issues with human rights, have been welcomed by the British governments in the past. And at least three controversial figures were allowed to address parliament by Mr Bercow himself.  2012 - Kuwait's Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah           Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, gave an address to members of both Houses of Parliament on Thursday, November 29 in the Queen's Robing Room, as part of his state visit to the UKSheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, gave an address to members of both Houses of Parliament on Thursday, November 29 in the Queen's Robing Room, as part of his state visit to the UK.Following his arrival at Sovereign's Entrance, The Emir of Kuwait was received by Black Rod, Lieutenant General David Leakey and was taken to the Queen's Robing Room.Commons Speaker, John Bercow MP, gave a welcome address introducing The Emir of Kuwait's speech.  Kuwait has banned its citizens from entering 'into an agreement, personally or indirectly, with entities or persons residing in Israel, or with Israeli citizenship'.The country also uses Sharia Law for family disputes - where a woman's testimony is not valued as highly as a man's.2015 - China's President Xi Jinping           The extraordinary intervention at a key moment in British-Chinese relations will cause deep embarrassment for the government which hopes to use the visit to secure billions of pounds in trade deals. Pictured is President Xi addressing MPs and peersProtesters attempting to highlight human rights violations clashed with pro-China supporters during a procession welcoming Chinese president Xi to the UK.Scuffles broke out between the two groups after the police perimeter set up for protesters was ignored by both sides.But thousands of supporters also lined The Mall to welcome Xi Jinping with flags, T-shirts and hats - provided by the Chinese embassy.1971 - Japan's Emperor Hirohito         Emperor Hirohito, Japan's wartime head of state, made his first state visit to Britain in 1971Emperor Hirohito, Japan's wartime head of state, made his first state visit to Britain in 1971.Former prisoners of war - angry at Japan's brutal militaristic past - protested by standing in silence as his carriage drove past.Some turned their back on the emperor and wore red gloves to symbolise war deaths while others whistled the popular Second World War march, Colonel Bogey.They called on Japan to offer them compensation and a full apology for their treatment during the war.1978 Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu         The President of Rumania, Nicolae Ceausescu, rides through London with the Queen in an open carriage, at the start of his state visitIt was the first state visit by a Communist head of state to the UK and Romania was already well-known as one of the most corrupt and oppressive of the Soviet Union's Cold War satellite states.The Queen took drastic steps to avoid meeting Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu any more than necessary, according to royal author Robert Hardman.'While walking her dogs in the Palace gardens, she spotted Ceausescu and his wife Elena heading in her direction.'As the Queen told a lunch guest some years later, she decided the best course of action was to hide behind a bush rather than conduct polite conversation,' he wrote.1998 Japan's Emperor AkihitoJust like his father did in 1971, Akihito met obvious hostility on London's streets from British prisoners of war.Former PoWs symbolically turned their backs on him, while others jeered him.Addressing the state banquet, Akihito spoke of his 'deep sorrow and pain' over the suffering inflicted by his country during the war, but did not apologise for the treatment of prisoners in work camps.2003 - Russia's Vladimir Putin         Her Majesty invited Russian President Vladimir Putin for a state visit in June 2003Mr Putin's historic trip was the first by a Russian head of state since Tsar Nicholas I in 1843.Amnesty International and other human rights groups used the visit to highlight ongoing reports of killings, rape and torture by Russian forces in Chechnya. 2003 - US president George W Bush         Tens of thousands of people came out to protest against George W Bush over the war in Iraq when the Queen hosted him in 2003. Pictured, the Queen and the President at Windsor CastlePresident George Bush's state visit, while Tony Blair was prime minister, was highly controversial.Tens of thousands of people came out to protest against the American leader and the war in Iraq, amid unprecedented security for a state visit.Demonstrations throughout Mr Bush's stay were mostly peaceful, and peaked with the toppling of an effigy of Mr Bush in Trafalgar Square, which parodied scenes of the capture of Baghdad.Stop The War Coalition said some 200,000 joined the demonstration.One protester threw an egg at the presidential cavalcade, but missed.2005 - Chinese president Hu Jintao         Tony Blair, Prime Minister, sees off President Hu Jintao of China (waving) from 10 Downing Street, LondonNoisy protests against Chinese rule in Tibet targeted Hu Jintao's state carriage procession.The Metropolitan Police was criticised for its hardline handling of the peaceful demonstrations, and admitted following a High Court case its officers acted unlawfully when they removed protesters' banners and flags.The Prince of Wales, a supporter of the Dalai Lama, had been accused of boycotting a Chinese state visit to the UK in 1999 by failing to attend the return banquet held for then-president Jiang Zemin.This time, during Hu Jintao's stay, Charles carefully side-stepped the issue by being out of the country on a tour of the US on the night of the official dinner.He did not meet Mr Hu on the remaining two days of his visit.2007 - Saudi Arabia's king Abdullah         Saudi Arabia's king Abdullah's state visit in 2007 revived controversy over his regime's abuse of human rights  The first state visit by a Saudi king to the UK for 20 years revived controversy over the regime's abuse of human rights and the government's halting of a Serious Fraud Office bribery inquiry into the al-Yamamah arms deal.Tensions surrounding the trip were heightened when the king insisted in an interview Britain was not doing enough to tackle terrorism.Around 100 human rights and anti-arms trade activists jeered and shouted 'shame on you' as the royal procession passed along The Mall in central London.2010 - Qatar's Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani         Prince Philip, Sheikha Mozah Bint Nasser Al Missned, Queen Elizabeth II and Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani         Queen Elizabeth II and Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al ThaniThe Emir of Qatar - a country which practices Sharia Law, involving lashes as punishments - was welcomed by Mr Bercow on October 26, 2010.Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani was welcomed by the Commons Speaker, John Bercow and thanked by the Lord Speaker, Baroness Hayman. The Sheikh also met the Queen with his second of three wives, Sheikha Mozah Bint Nasser Al Missned.   The Commons Speaker said China should aspire to be seen as a 'moral inspiration' to the world as it takes its place as an international superpower.Mr Bercow said 'the world will be watching' the Asian nation's progress. Mr Bercow referred to 'the wise Chinese words' that 'it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness'.'We very much hope that your time here will assist the process of illumination,' he told Mr Xi.He has also welcomed other controversial leaders, including the Emir of Kuwait in 2012 and the Emir of Qatar in 2010.Commons speakers are among the most powerful people within the Westminster system but they are expected to be independent.By tradition, when elected speakers are literally dragged to the Commons chair.But once installed convention dictates they set aside their own politics to stand up for the rights of all MPs.

The Chinese people have many, many, friends in this Parliament.'Those friends are familiar with what you, Mr President, have described as the ""Chinese Dream"" and which others have referred to as a second Chinese Revolution. 'Your country is engaged in an experience and an experiment without equal in history. 'You are attempting to complete an industrial revolution which took Britain the better part of two centuries in little more than two decades. Your country has seen a transformation in how its people work and in what they rightly expect for themselves, for their families and for their society. The enormous challenge of how to deal with this falls to you and to your colleagues.'Yet what China does, economically but also politically, is seen by, and relevant to not merely your own 1.5bn citizens. It is seen by and relevant to billions more across the globe. 'The world will be watching and waiting expectantly on the outcome as the emerging superpower that is China takes its new place in the world. In this century, no country can exist in isolation: in all matters, from international law to individual liberty, we should all aspire to be seen not merely as a powerful force in the world, but as a moral inspiration to it.'In all this, we can usefully reflect on the wise Chinese words that it is'We very much hope that your time here will assist the process of illumination.

Change, as you have publicly recognised, is essential if the popular demand for representation is to be met, human rights entrenched and prosperity enhanced.'Our two countries are signatories to a range of international human rights conventions and compliance with their letter and spirit is vital. Equality before the law, irrespective of race, gender, disability or orientation, is fundamental to our society here in the UK and we expect to be held to that standard.'Naturally, we hope that that principle of equality will be practised and championed across the world. Rest assured there are many, many friends of your country both within this Parliament and Britain at large and we all stand ready to support Kuwait in exercising leadership in a modern, open and progressive direction.'Your presence here can only encourage dialogue between us. I therefore invite you to address this audience and I look forward enormously to hearing what you have to say.'     Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: 'Well said John Bercow.

Chinese state broadcaster CCTV showed Xi and Kim taking a seaside stroll in the northeastern city of Dalian and holding talks, while the official Xinhua news agency said the two leaders met on Monday and Tuesday. It was Kim's second visit to China since March, highlighting efforts by the Cold War-era allies to mend ties that have chilled as Beijing has supported UN sanctions over Pyongyang's nuclear activities. Beijing is keen to avoid being left out in the cold in the wake of Kim's historic summit last month with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his planned meeting with Trump in June. ""After the first meeting between me and Comrade Chairman (Kim), both China-DPRK relations and the Korean peninsula situation have made positive progress. I feel happy about it,"" Xi said, according to Xinhua. For his part, Kim was quoted as saying: ""These are the positive outcomes of the historic meeting between me and Comrade General Secretary (Xi).""

Presidents Mauricio Macri of Argentina and Xi Jinping of China announced the more than 30 agriculture and investment deals during a state visit following the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires. The deals include an agreement to export Argentine cherries to China and an expansion of a currency swap. China is among Argentina's top export markets, especially for agricultural commodities that are the engine of its economy. It is also one of Argentina's biggest lenders, financing about $18.2 billion in infrastructure and other projects, according to the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. ""China's development benefits Argentina, our region and the world,"" Macri said during a ceremony at the presidential residence in the outskirts of the Argentine capital. ""We have complementary countries. There are few countries in the world that can buy so many of the high-quality products that we're capable of making,"" Macri said. The visit comes after U.S. officials said they had reached a 90-day truce in the trade dispute with China that has rattled financial markets and imperiled global economic growth. That announcement followed a Saturday dinner meeting between Xi and President Donald Trump.

The South American country is home to the world's top polo players, and Macri said that he wants the sport to make a comeback in China. Photos released by Argentina's presidency showed a smiling Xi petting the pony with one hand and holding the reins with the other. Macri also put a red polo helmet emblazoned with China's flag on Xi's head. Xi congratulated Macri on a successful summit and said both of their nations believe the G-20 spirit of solidarity must prevail in ""the firm defense of multilateralism and free trade to build an open global economy and foment the world's prosperity and stability."" Xi then flew to Panama, which has been negotiating a free-trade deal with China after shifting its diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taiwan last year, a move that led to complaints from U.S. officials. Chinese companies operate ports on both ends of the Panama Canal, which for most of the 20th Century was seen as a symbol of U.S. influence. Xi was met at the airport by Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, and the two leaders planned a private working meeting Monday. The Chinese leader also planned to visit the Cocoli locks on the Pacific end of the canal.

The ministry said the two leaders agreed to “strengthen economic exchanges” but gave no indication whether they made any progress on settling an escalating tariff war over Beijing’s technology policy. Mr Trump said earlier on Twitter that he and Mr Xi had a “very good” conversation. A foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said: “I agree, this phone conversation was an extremely positive phone conversation.” Just had a long and very good conversation with President Xi Jinping of China. We talked about many subjects, with a heavy emphasis on Trade. Those discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina.

199,All of a flutter: Chinese bet big on World Cup,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5916157/All-flutter-Chinese-bet-big-World-Cup.html," 04:34 BST, 4 July 2018 ","          Fans watch the 2018 Russia World Cup round of 16 football match between Brazil and Mexico at a China Sports Lottery outlet in Shanghai  At Xia Lugen's run-down, smoky betting shop in downtown Shanghai, hordes of young men cluster around banks of computers, as betting slips and a huge World Cup chart adorn the walls and a projector beams matches onto a makeshift screen. China may not have a team at the World Cup in Russia but this has not dampened the enthusiasm of the country's gamblers, with bets in the first three weeks already outstripping the whole of the 2014 tournament in Brazil. Energetic betting in these technically illegal, but officially sanctioned shops reflects the prevailing attitude towards sports, which are seen as a chance to make money as much as a spectacle to be enjoyed. Before the first knockout game between France and Argentina, punters -- known as caimin, or ""lottery citizens"", in Chinese -- queued up to place large bets.          China has spent 28.6 billion yuan in football betting in the three weeks up to July 1, dwarfing the less than five billion wagered in the three weeks previous to that, according to figures from the China Sports Lottery Management Centre  Gao Liushun, 55, had previously lost a bundle on Argentina, so doubled down on an Argentinian win because ""I need to win back what I lost, right?"" He lost 1,000 yuan ($150) after France's thrilling 4-3 victory, his heaviest loss of the World Cup so far. Fellow gambler Xia Junmin, a 25-year-old freelancer, lost five times that amount after wagering on a draw. - Underground betting - The World Cup-inspired surge in betting is borne out in the official figures. China has spent 28.6 billion yuan in football betting in the three weeks up to July 1, dwarfing the less than five billion wagered in the three weeks previous to that, according to figures from the China Sports Lottery Management Centre.          China bets on the World Cup  This is more than double the roughly 11.5 billion yuan wagered during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and does not take into account underground betting and syndicated gambling, which is widespread in the country. China's underground gambling networks are often cited as an impetus for match-fixing incidents worldwide, usually in obscure leagues but also in Italy's Serie A and occasionally in World Cup qualifiers. Although all gambling is technically illegal in China, it is permitted in the country's hundreds and thousands of ""lottery shops"". These are run by China's Sports Administration with part of the proceeds ploughed back into sport ranging from financing stadiums to training the next generation of Chinese athletes. However, the government remains vigilant and dozens of unauthorised ""lottery ticket"" apps, which enable punters to place a bet with a single click, were closed down in the first week of the World Cup. - 'Everyone is watching it' - Xia converted his auto dealership into a ""lottery shop"" six years ago and business has boomed during the World Cup, with hundreds of thousands of yuan being bet daily -- more than 10 times the stakes for a normal day. Despite the absence of home interest, the World Cup ""has brought out the passion from people who were not interested in football before"", he told AFP.          China may not have a team at the World Cup in Russia but this has not dampened the enthusiasm of the country's gamblers, with bets in the first three weeks already outstripping the whole of the 2014 tournament in Brazil  ""Everyone is watching it. People who didn't bet are all betting now,"" said the 59-year-old Shanghai local, who also has cashiers taking bets over the phone. Like punters all over the world, many gamblers in China lost a packet during some of the tournament's more surprising results, especially the demise of defending champions Germany, who failed to get out of the group stage for the first time since 1938. Li Feng, a gambler who has rigged up a big screen at his fried chicken joint to show the games, said he had lost 1,000 yuan betting on Die Mannschaft to beat the unfancied South Koreans in the group stage. But in one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history, South Korea beat the footballing superpower 2-0 with two late goals to break German hearts -- and Li's. ""No sane person would have bet on South Korea to win,"" he complained bitterly. Gao Liushan, a regular at the bookies, said he was disappointed that China did not make it to the World Cup finals this time around. ""To be frank, China not making it was harmful to us,"" he said. ""But President Xi Jinping said don't forget your first love. The Chinese dream will be realised one day. I also believe in Chinese football. The dream will be realised in the near future."""

203,Separatists blamed for China knife attack; 33 dead,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2571261/Separatists-blamed-China-knife-attack-33-dead.html," 20:51 BST, 2 March 2014 ","Separatists blamed for China knife attack; 33 dead By Associated Press   Published: 20:51 BST, 2 March 2014  |  Updated: 20:52 BST, 2 March 2014                e-mail         KUNMING, China (AP) — Authorities on Sunday blamed a slashing rampage that killed 29 people and wounded 143 at a train station in southern China on separatists from the country's far west, while local residents said government crackdowns had taken their toll on the alleged culprits.Police fatally shot four of the assailants — putting the overall death toll at 33 — and captured another after the attack late Saturday in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, the official Xinhua News Agency said. But authorities were searching for at least five more of the black-clad attackers.State broadcaster CCTV said two of the assailants were women, including one of the slain and the one detained.        Police officers talk near luggages left by victims and have not been claimed outside the Kunming Railway Station where more than 10 assailants slashed scores of people with knives the night before in Kunming, in western China's Yunnan province, Sunday, March 2, 2014. Authorities blamed a slashing rampage that killed 29 people and wounded 143 at a train station in southern China on separatists from the country's far west and vowed a harsh crackdown Sunday, while residents wondered why their laid-back city was targeted. (AP Photo/Alexander F. Yuan) ""All-out efforts should be made to treat the injured people, severely punish terrorists according to the law, and prevent the occurrence of similar cases,"" said China's top police official, Politburo member Meng Jianzhu, who arrived in Kunming early Sunday, an indication of how seriously authorities viewed the attack.The attackers' identities have not been confirmed, but evidence at the scene showed that it was ""a terrorist attack carried out by Xinjiang separatist forces,"" Xinhua said. The far western region of Xinjiang is home to a simmering rebellion against Chinese rule by some members of the Muslim Uighur (pronounced WEE'-gur) population, and the government has responded there with heavy-handed security.Police in Kunming on Sunday were rounding up members of the city's small Uighur community, believed to number no more than several dozen, for questioning in the attack and information about the assailants.""How do we know them?"" said a Uighur man who gave only his first name, Akpar. ""We could not tell if the assailants were Uighurs as they were all dressed in black. We did not like the attack either.""Most attacks blamed on Uighur separatists take place in Xinjiang, where clashes between Uighurs and police or members of China's ethnic Han majority are frequent, but Saturday's assault happened more than 1,500 kilometers (more than 900 miles) to the southeast in Yunnan, which has not had a history of such unrest.Kunming residents expressed dismay at both the attack and the conditions within China that could have allowed it to happen.Restaurant worker Xie Yulong said the attackers were ""worse than animals."" But he also expressed sympathy toward ethnic Uighurs, saying their region has come under severe security crackdowns in recent months under the government of President Xi Jinping.""It's the pressure,"" Xie said. ""Beijing has put too much pressure on them since Xi Jinping took over. They are under so much pressure they do not want to live, and they did that.""Another Kunming resident, Jiang Hua, said the attack has made people scared to go out at night.""I think we should chase off the Uighurs and let them be independent,"" Jiang said. ""And local authorities should be held accountable for providing public safety.""Witnesses described assailants dressed in black storming the train station late Saturday evening and slashing people indiscriminately with large knives and machetes.Student Qiao Yunao, 16, was waiting to catch a train at the station when people started crying out and running, and then saw a man cut another man's neck, drawing blood.""I was freaking out, and ran to a fast food store, and many people were running in there to take refuge,"" she told The Associated Press via Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblog. ""I saw two attackers, both men, one with a watermelon knife and the other with a fruit knife. They were running and chopping whoever they could.""Alarms over a possible spread of militant attacks to soft targets beyond the borders of Xinjiang were first raised in October when a suicide car attack blamed on three ethnic Uighurs killed five people, including the attackers, at Beijing's Tiananmen Gate.Sean Roberts, a cultural anthropologist at George Washington University who has studied Uighurs and China for two decades, said the Kunming violence would be a new kind of attack for ethnic Uighurs — premeditated, well-organized and outside Xinjiang — but still rudimentary in weaponry.""If it is true that it was carried out by Uighurs, it's much different than anything we've seen to date,"" Roberts said by phone.But he added that it is still unclear whether there is any organized Uighur militant group, and that attacks so far do not appear linked to any ""global terrorist network, because we're not seeing things like sophisticated explosives or essentially sophisticated tactics.""The U.N. Security Council on Sunday issued a press statement that ""condemned in the strongest terms the terrorist attack"" on the train station. The statement reiterated that ""any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivation"" and underlined the need to bring those responsible for the attack to justice.The violence in Kunming came at a sensitive time, with political leaders in Beijing preparing for Wednesday's opening of the annual legislature, where Xi's government will deliver its first one-year work report.Willy Lam, a political observer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the attack coming so close to the National People's Congress dented Xi's message of a ""Chinese Dream"" coalescing under his rule.""Pockets of dissatisfaction, groups of people with grievances, appear to be increasing. After 1 1/2 years of more heavy-handed control (in Xinjiang), the report card does not look good,"" Lam said.Xi called for ""all-out efforts"" to bring the culprits to justice. The Security Management Bureau, which is under the Ministry of Public Security, said in a statement that police would ""crack down on the crimes in accordance with the law without any tolerance.""The attack was the deadliest violence attributed to Uighur-Han conflicts since riots in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi in 2009, in which Uighurs stormed the streets of the city, targeting Han people in seemingly random violence that included the killing of women and children. A few days later, Han vigilante mobs armed with sticks and bats attacked Uighurs in the same city. Nearly 200 people died.___Associated Press writers Ian Mader, Gillian Wong and Louise Watt and video producer Aritz Parra in Beijing, and researcher Fu Ting in Shanghai, contributed to this report.

204,The Latest: Tibetan group protests at China Embassy in India,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4991376/The-Latest-Xi-calls-China-step-tech-development.html," 05:09 BST, 18 October 2017 "," BEIJING (AP) - The Latest on the ruling Communist Party's congress meeting in Beijing (all times local): 3 p.m. Members of the Tibetan Youth Congress have protested at the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi as China's ruling Communists opened their national congress.          Exile Tibetans hold themselves together as policemen try to detain them during a protest near the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, India, Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2017. Nearly two dozen members of the Tibetan Youth Congress on Wednesday protested opposing a second five-year term for Chinese President Xi Jinpin as the ruling Communist Party's congress meeting opened in Beijing. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup)  The protesters held up placards blaming China for occupation and genocide in Tibet. Indian police blocked the nearly two dozen protesters from entering the building. Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to get a second five-year term as party leader at the meeting that opened in Beijing on Wednesday. The protesters called Xi a dictator whose continued rule would be dangerous. Tibetan Youth Congress President Tenzing Jigme said in a statement that Tibet had nothing to celebrate as Buddhist monasteries have been destroyed and young Tibetans have self-immolated in frustration. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Xi Jinping says China ""has the resolve, the confidence and the ability"" to defeat any Taiwanese bid for formal independence. He said Beijing would continue to pursue peaceful means to bring under control the self-governing island but that China would never allow the permanent separation of ""any part"" of China. Xi spoke at the opening of the Communist Party's national congress on Wednesday. Taiwan was a Japanese colony for 50 years, then split from the mainland amid civil war in 1949. China cut off contacts with Taiwan's government last year to punish its independence-leaning president for refusing to endorse Beijing's position that Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory. ___ 11:20 a.m. President Xi Jinping has called for China's ruling Communist Party to step up technology development, an area in which Beijing faces complaints it encourages theft of foreign know-how and blocks access to emerging industries. Xi gave the keynote address at the opening of the party congress Wednesday. He called for making China a ""country of innovators"" and to create competitors in aerospace, cyberspace, transportation and other areas. Xi promised to promote cooperation among universities, state companies and small enterprises. China's technology development has prompted complaints by foreign governments and companies that Beijing encourages theft of foreign intellectual property. President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into whether China improperly requires companies to hand over technology as a condition of market access. ___ 10 a.m. Chinese President Xi Jinping has told a key Communist Party congress that the nation's prospects are bright but the challenges are severe. Such warnings have been made by others as China's economy faces pressure from weak global demand that threatens the nation's export industries. But Xi's comments Wednesday in a keynote speech meant to highlight the party's confidence and long-range vision are an unusual acknowledgement of challenging times ahead. Xi is expected to get a second five-year term as party leader at the gathering.

209,"Nuclear summit with North Korean leader may be delayed, Trump warns",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-5758905/Nuclear-summit-North-Korean-leader-delayed-Trump-warns.html," 18:51 BST, 22 May 2018 "," US President Donald Trump has suggested that a planned historic meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un could be delayed. “There’s a very substantial chance that it won’t work out” for June 12, he said. Mr Trump raised the possibility that the meeting could be pushed back during a White House meeting with South Korea President Moon Jae-in, trying to co-ordinate strategy as concerns mounted over ensuring a successful outcome for the North Korea summit.          Donald Trump with South Korean President Moon Jae-In in the Oval Office (Evan Vucci/AP)  He told reporters: “If it doesn’t happen, maybe it happens later,” reflecting recent setbacks in efforts to bring about reconciliation between the two Koreas. The North pulled out of planned peace talks with the South last week, objecting to long-scheduled joint military exercises between US and Republic of Korea forces. And the North threatened to abandon the planned Trump-Kim meeting over US insistence on denuclearising the peninsula. “There are certain conditions that we want,” Mr Trump said on Tuesday. He added that if they were not met, “we won’t have the meeting”. He declined to elaborate on those conditions. Mr Trump said “there’s a very substantial chance” that the meeting will not take place on June 12. “That doesn’t mean it won’t work out over a period of time,” he said. “But it may not work out for June 12. But there is a good chance that we’ll have the meeting.” Mr Moon said in the Oval Office that the “fate and the future” of the Korean Peninsula hinged on the talks, telling the US president that they were “one step closer” to the dream of a denuclearised Korean Peninsula. Mr Trump said he had noticed “a little change” in Kim Jong Un’s “attitude” after Kim took a second trip to China this month in the run-up to the summit. “I don’t like that,” Mr Trump said. Mr Trump said he hoped that Chinese President Xi Jinping was committed to the goal of denuclearising the Korean peninsula, calling him a world-class poker player. But he said he was displeased by China’s softening of border enforcement measures against North Korea. Mr Trump encouraged Mr Kim to seize the opportunity for the meeting and to make a deal to abandon his nuclear programme, pledging not only to guarantee Mr Kim’s personal security, but also predicting an economic revitalisation for the North. “I will guarantee his safety, yes,” Mr Trump said, if Mr Kim agreed to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation. He said if an agreement was reached, China, Japan and South Korea would invest large sums to “make North Korea great”."
210,Shanghai looks to Olympic hosts in push to become 'sports city',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6108781/Shanghai-looks-Olympic-hosts-push-sports-city.html," 04:47 BST, 29 August 2018 ","          Shanghai official Luo Wenhua says the city wants to learn from other Olympic hosts and become a major sports city  Shanghai aspires to become a sporting capital like Olympic hosts Tokyo and Paris, and staging a Games would be ""the highest ideal"", a top city official says. While stopping short of committing to an Olympic bid, Shanghai's deputy director general of sports told AFP that officials in China's biggest city would be taking an interest in how Tokyo and Paris fare with the Summer Games in 2020 and 2024. ""It's not the first time for these world-renowned sports cities to host the Olympic Games. They must have a lot of good experience in hosting,"" Luo Wenhua, of the Shanghai Administration of Sports, said in a rare interview with international media. ""I think the next step may be to strengthen communication and let us learn from them."" Shanghai already hosts several major annual sporting events including a Formula One race, men's and women's golf, Diamond League athletics and the Shanghai Masters tennis, which is just a rung below Grand Slams and the ATP Finals. In total, Shanghai stages about 160 sports events per year, Luo said. It's part of a push by the Chinese city's authorities to make Shanghai a ""globally famous"" sports metropolis by 2025. Luo name-checked Tokyo, Paris, Los Angeles, London and New York as cities to emulate. Of those, only New York has never hosted an Olympics and after the success of Beijing 2008, it seems almost inevitable that Shanghai will one day bid. The next available Summer Games slot is 2032. Beijing will become the first city to stage both a Summer and Winter Games when it puts on the 2022 Winter Olympics, underlining China's enduring appetite for the Games. ""Speaking for myself as a sportsman, and for each athlete, participating in the Olympics is the ultimate goal,"" said Luo, a former pole vaulter. ""For a sportsman, hosting an integrated sports event like the Olympics would be the highest ideal and a dream."" But Luo stressed that any bid is a decision for China's central government, ""not one made by a city. If the conditions are mature, we may have such a thought (to bid)"". - 'Capital of eSports' - When Beijing hosted the 2008 Olympics there was plenty of backslapping as China topped the medals table for the first time. At the ongoing Asian Games in Indonesia, China are at their regular spot atop the medals chart, swelling national pride. But Luo sees a subtle shift afoot as disposable incomes grow and sports participation rises in China, the world's second-biggest economy after the United States. ""In the past, people usually asked me how many gold medals we would win during the Olympic Games,"" he said. ""But now they will ask me where the nearest facility for sport is in their neighbourhood or if there are any events that they can participate in."" Under President Xi Jinping, China's communist government is on a drive to get more people exercising. Football is the centrepiece of the initiative, and while the city of 24 million people is very much part of the push, Luo said Shanghai's government wants to ramp up interest and participation across a range of sports. That drive includes eSports -- though hardly associated with stringent exercise -- which is growing fast across the world and has found a strong following in China. ""Shanghai has also proposed to become the capital of eSports. Now eSports is a hot topic,"" Luo said. ""I believe some of the world´s top eSports events will choose to settle in Shanghai in the near future."""
211,Rough waters ahead: Aggressive actions by Beijing are forcing a recalibration in India,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3760765/Rough-waters-ahead-Beijing-s-actions-South-China-Sea-forcing-recalibration-India.html," 22:36 BST, 26 August 2016 ","Chinese Foreign Minister’s visit to India this month has done little to bring a semblance of normalcy to Sino-Indian ties. Just weeks after the Indian government cleared the deployment of a special version of the BrahMos cruise missile in Arunachal Pradesh, Chinese state media has warned that such a move would have “a negative influence” on stability along the border. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in China to attend the G-20 summit in Hangzhou next month.          A missile is launched from the Chinese Navy's guided-missile destroyer Taizhou during a live ammunition drill in the East China SeaFollowing the ruling by an international tribunal last month which rejected Beijing’s claims over much of the disputed South China Sea area, China is campaigning against the issue to be raised in G20 Summit saying it is a matter to be resolved between parties concerned and outsider has no role. Chinese president Xi Jinping will also visit Goa for the coming BRICS summit scheduled for October. Media Ahead of the Chinese Foreign Minister’s visit, Chinese state media had warned India to avoid “unnecessary entanglement with China over the South China Sea debate” if New Delhi “wishes to create a good atmosphere for economic cooperation.” Terming that India and China are partners, not rivals, the state-run Xinhua news agency has also suggested that the door for India's admission into the NSG is “not tightly” closed and New Delhi should “fully comprehend” Beijing’s concerns over the disputed South China Sea. Wang Yi’s visit was the first high-level visit between the two countries after China blocked India’s Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) membership bid at the plenary meeting of the 48-nation grouping in June on the grounds that it was not a signatory to the NPT. During his visit, Wang said it is up to India to decide what position it wishes to take vis-à-vis the ongoing issue. Wang's visit also came just days after Chinese troops “transgressed” the border on land and by air in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand last month. India-China bilateral trade which totalled around $70 billion last year tilted heavily in favour of Beijing with over $46 billion trade deficit. And then in his Independence Day address to the nation, PM Narendra Modi threw down a gauntlet not only to Pakistan but also to China with his reference to the people of Balochistan, the people of Gilgit, and the people of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. PoK is a key transit point in the ambitious $45 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that will give Beijing access to the Arabian Sea through the port of Gwadar. China’s plans to build infrastructure in POK and Gilgit, territory claimed by India, have irritated India and New Delhi has informed Beijing of its strong views. Sino-Indian ties have entered a rough patch and this issue has not helped matters. So Modi’s message to China too was categorical that without India’s support, CPEC would remain a pipe-dream as India too has levers it can pull to scuttle the project. Pakistan will be concerned as resource-rich Balochistan is the home of the Gwadar port being built with massive investment from China. China is already concerned about the security of its investments traversing through this area and has pushed for the Pakistan Army to be given a leading role, over civilian authorities. Meanwhile, tensions are rising in Asia as China takes steps to assert its control over the waters of South China Sea after its claims were rejected by an international tribunal at the Hague last month. China’s Defence Minister Chang Wanquan has called for a “people’s war at sea” to push back against threats to Chinese claims. In a speech last week, he warned of maritime security threats and called for increased preparations for what he termed a “people’s war at sea” in order to “safeguard sovereignty”. Dispute More significantly, China is also changing its laws to arrest and jail anyone caught fishing in waters Beijing considers its own, even though many of those waters are precisely the bits that are disputed among China’s neighbours in the South China Sea. Last week, China’s Supreme Court said people caught illegally fishing in Chinese waters could be jailed for up to a year, issuing a judicial interpretation defining those waters as including the country’s exclusive economic zones. Over the past few weeks, all three Chinese naval fleets have taken to the sea to practice for a “sudden, cruel, and short” conflict. Beijing has also begun to fly bomber and fighter aircraft near disputed islands in the South China Sea.It has also announced that it would hold joint naval drills in the waters with Russia in September, terming the drills “routine” and not directed at any third party.A group of new photographs have revealed the construction of several reinforced aircraft hangars at Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs, all land formations built up by China in recent months, on which the Chinese have also built runways. Neighbours China’s neighbours too aren’t keeping quiet.Reports have emerged of Vietnam secretly fortifying several of its islands in the disputed South China Sea with new mobile rocket launchers capable of striking China’s runways and military installations across the vital trade route. Japan filed a protest with Beijing over recently discovered radar equipment China secretly installed in a gas exploration platform close to disputed waters in the East China Sea. Japan is concerned that the radar could be a signal that China will begin using gas exploration platforms as military outposts. The protest came on the same day an armada of 13 Chinese Coast Guard ships sailed into waters just outside what Japan considers its territorial waters in the East China Sea. At this time of regional flux, India’s ties with China have entered a phase where antagonistic posturing is the new norm. China’s openly hostile acts are forcing a recalibration in India. India will have to work with other regional states as to make sure that China does not upend the regional balance of power to everyone’s disadvantage. The writer is

212,Alaska signs gas pipeline project deal with China,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5064833/Alaska-signs-deal-advance-pipeline-help-China.html," 05:35 BST, 9 November 2017 "," ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - The state of Alaska took a major step toward realizing a long-sought pipeline to move natural gas from the North Slope to Asia, siding with interests from China after major oil companies stepped back from the project. The agreement Alaska Gov. Bill Walker signed Thursday in Beijing with Sinopec, China Investment Corp. and the Bank of China does not guarantee a pipeline will be built, but it gives the lingering liquefied natural gas project a jolt of life. ""This is the market responding, and we're very, very pleased with that,"" Walker told reporters in a teleconference from Beijing.          FILE - In this Tuesday, April 18, 2017, file photo, Alaska Gov. Bill Walker addresses reporters during a news conference in Juneau, Alaska. The state of Alaska will attempt to advance a multibillion dollar natural gas pipeline project with the help of interests from China. Walker said the agreement signed late Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2017, is with Sinopec, China Investment Corp. and the Bank of China. (AP Photo/Becky Bohrer, File)  The agreement was signed as both U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping watched. No financial terms were released, but it's been estimated that the project could cost $43 billion. The agreement means all parties will work on various aspects of the project, including marketing and financing with a status check in 2018. The goal, Walker said, is to have definitive contracts signed by the end of 2018. Construction would start the following year, with the goal to have the pipeline operational by 2024 or 2025. Representatives of Sinopec and the Bank of China toured operations on the North Slope and visited facilities in Anchorage before making their decision, which had to be approved by the Chinese government. ""This has been a long courtship with these folks,"" said Keith Meyer, the president of the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., the state-sponsored entity advancing the project. Negotiations began in May, he said. In the agreement, Sinopec would be the customer buying the gas, the bank would be the lender for Sinopec and China Investment Corp. would be an investor if there were to be an equity investment in the project. The Alaska corporation would retain majority ownership, Meyer, said. About 75 percent of the LNG would go to China, with Alaska retaining 25 percent for other regional markets in Asia, including Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. ""I look forward to seeing the details, but at first glance, this joint development agreement is very encouraging for the thousands of Alaskans who never lost hope that a natural gas pipeline could one day become a reality,"" Alaska House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, a Democrat, said in a statement.  ""A pipeline project will bring jobs, investment, and, perhaps most importantly, a renewed sense of hope that Alaska's best days are ahead of us, not behind."" The pipeline as envisioned would rival the famed trans-Alaska oil pipeline, a major building project of a generation ago. The natural gas pipeline is intended to tap into the rich natural gas reserves on the North Slope. Similar in length to the oil pipeline, it would transport the gas 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) to the coast on the Kenai Peninsula, where it would be liquefied and shipped to Asia. Such a pipeline has been a dream for Alaskans for years, seen as a way to provide economic certainty as oil production from the North Slope declines. Estimates have put proven gas reserves on the North Slope overall at 35 trillion cubic feet. Alaska could provide a generation's worth of liquefied natural gas to China, Walker told the Chinese president when Xi stopped in Anchorage on a layover in April. Millions have been spent a pipeline project, which has been marred in recent years by changes in direction, waning interest among state legislators and low natural gas prices. The state took lead on the project with the blessing of major oil companies, who plan to provide gas to the project from their leased North Slope fields but focused priorities elsewhere. Walker has said this would be a make-or-break year for the proposed project, and he's been working to secure commitments from countries in Asia to buy the gas or be partners in the project. The state opened an office in Tokyo to help market its gas, and Walker himself has traveled abroad looking for commitments. This comes on the heels of a June announcement that the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corp. signed an agreement with the Korea Gas Corp., establishing a cooperative framework for the development of Alaska's natural gas infrastructure. ___ Associated Press writer Becky Bohrer contributed to this report from Juneau, Alaska."

Only the top three of the six contenders will progress.Despite being the world's most populous country and second-largest economy, and money pouring into the domestic game after President Xi Jinping declared ambitions to host and one day win the World Cup, China remain minnows on the global football stage.        China's national football coach Gao Hongbo announced his resignation after their 2-0 defeat to Uzbekistan on October 11, 2016 ©Karim Jaafar (AFP/File) The team has only ever qualified for one World Cup and are currently ranked a lowly 78th in the world by FIFA.""I will leave the national team because of poor health,"" Gao told a press conference after the Uzbekistan match, the official Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday.But he acknowledged discussing his future with Chinese Football Association bosses before the game, according to the Asian Football Confederation website.""We agreed if we couldn't reach a positive result against Uzbekistan I would stand down from my post,” it quoted him as saying.“As a result of this defeat, I bring an end to my time in charge of the China national team.""Gao, a former striker for the national team, previously managed the side in 2009-11 and was reappointed in February, after Frenchman Alain Perrin was sacked following embarrassing performances including a draw with Hong Kong.Under Gao, China squeaked into the third round of World Cup qualifying, but they endured a humiliating loss at home to war-torn Syria last week and their sole point so far came from a 0-0 draw with Iran.""I hope the China national team will be better in the future and we will meet in football again,” Gao said.- 'Rotten meat' -Gao ""failed to mould an effective formation nor playing style for the Chinese team"", Xinhua said, adding that while there were six matches left in the stage, ""the performances of the Chinese team have not given the fans any hope"".But many fans defended Gao on social media, blaming the Chinese Football Association and the players themselves for the team's woes.""The men's team is like rotten meat, and the coach is like the fridge. The meat already stinks, but management doesn't think to toss it out for fresh stuff, it just keeps changing the fridge,"" wrote one user on the Twitter-like platform Weibo.Gao's brief tenure is even shorter than the average -- since 2000 the side has had 10 coaches, five of them European and five Chinese.After his first stint in charge Gao was replaced by Spaniard Jose Antonio Camacho on a lucrative contract, and talk was already turning to the subject of new successor Wednesday.One supporter wrote that ""whenever the national team loses, they just want to switch coach, and always invite a foreign coach. It's not a confident attitude -- it has a bad impact on head coaches, players, local coaches ... It's just worshipping foreign things.""Fans called for the sacking of China's football association president Cai Zhenhua after the defeat to Syria, but he has ignored them so far, instead urging the players ""not to lose confidence"" over their losses.Earlier this year Beijing issued a plan to make Team Dragon one of the world's top sides by 2050, promising 20,000 academies and 30 million elementary and middle school pupils playing the sport within four years.Following the blueprint would bring to life ""the sports-superpower dream” and ""national revival dream"", it said.But despite official backing and huge spending by domestic club owners the national team's travails make hosting the World Cup look a far more realistic goal than winning the competition, as China's sole appearance in 2002 ended without a single point or even a goal.Chinese Super League clubs splashed more than 400 million euros ($447 million) on players this year, luring stars such as Liverpool target Alex Teixeira.China's next match is at home to 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar next month.

(Lintao Zhang/Pool Photo via AP)While few details of his talks have been released, Tillerson appeared to strike a cordial tone during his meetings in Beijing, in contrast to Trump's tough talk on Chinese economic competition during his presidential campaign.Xi told Tillerson that China considered his meetings Saturday with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and top diplomat Yang Jiechi to have been productive and constructive.""Both (Trump) and I believe that we need to make joint efforts to advance China-U.S. cooperation and we believe that we can make sure the relationship will move ahead in a constructive fashion in the new era,"" Xi said.Tillerson's Beijing visit followed his remarks in South Korea on Friday that pre-emptive military action against North Korea might be necessary if the threat from its weapons program reaches a level ""that we believe requires action.""China, the North's biggest source of diplomatic support and economic assistance, hasn't responded directly to those comments, although Beijing has called repeatedly for all sides to take steps to reduce tensions.China has agreed reluctantly to U.N. Security Council resolutions sanctioning North Korea, but is adamantly opposed to measures that might bring about a collapse of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime. Beijing fears Kim's fall would send waves of refugees into northeastern China and see South Korean and American forces taking up positions along its border.Beijing's patience with Pyongyang appears to be growing thin, however. Last month, China potentially deprived Kim's regime of a crucial source of foreign currency by banning imports of North Korean coal for the rest of the year.On Sunday, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he and his advisers discussed North Korea before returning to Washington from a weekend at his private club in Florida. On that subject, Trump said: ""He's acting badly. He's acting very, very badly.""

215,China's Xi in Hong Kong for anniversary as protests planned,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4649460/Chinas-Xi-visit-Hong-Kong-heavy-security.html," 04:42 BST, 29 June 2017 "," HONG KONG (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping landed in Hong Kong Thursday to mark the 20th anniversary of Beijing taking control of the former British colony, accompanied by a formidable layer of security as authorities showed little patience for pro-democracy protests. After stepping off his Air China plane, Xi said he envisioned ""stable development"" of Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems"" framework. Pro-democracy activists fear Beijing is undermining the principle - agreed upon when Britain handed over the city back to China - which guarantees Hong Kong can mostly run its own affairs and keep civil liberties including free speech until 2047. Xi's three-day visit culminates Saturday when he will oversee an inauguration ceremony for the Asian financial hub's new leader, Carrie Lam.          Chinese President Xi Jinping, center, accompanied by Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, rear left, and Chief Executive-elect Carrie Lam, rear right, arrives at Hong Kong's airport, Thursday, June 29, 2017. Hong Kong is planning a big party as it marks 20 years under Chinese rule. But many people in the former British colony are not in the mood to celebrate. Fireworks, a gala variety show and Chinese military displays are among the official events planned to coincide with a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping starting Thursday for the occasion. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)  Pro-democracy activists staged protests ahead of his visit and more were expected, including an annual march through the streets on Saturday that has drawn big crowds in the past. Hong Kong authorities were taking no chances with disruptions and deployed heavy security across the city. Helicopters hovered overhead and police and barricades lined the streets around a downtown convention center and hotel complex where Xi was expected to spend most of his time. Officers questioned passers-by taking photos of the few protests allowed near the area. Authorities even glued the gaps between sidewalk paving stones in an effort to prevent them from being torn up and thrown by protesters. Three pro-democracy groups said 26 of their members were arrested Wednesday evening on public nuisance charges for staging a sit-in at a giant flower sculpture near the complex. They were still detained hours after Xi arrived. Police have the power to hold them up to 48 hours. Those arrested included Joshua Wong, the young activist who helped lead 2014's ""Umbrella Movement"" protests, and Nathan Law, another student protest leader who was elected to the legislature last year. Xi is visiting to mark the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover, when Britain ceded control of its colony to China at the stroke of midnight on June 30, 1997. ""It's been nine years since I last set foot in this place. I'm thrilled,"" Xi said on the airport tarmac. ""Hong Kong has been tugging away at my heart,"" he said, adding that the anniversary of Hong Kong's ""return to the motherland"" on Saturday is ""a big deal, a joyous occasion for the country and for Hong Kong."" He said one of the purposes of his trip is to plan for Hong Kong's future. ""We would like to look back at Hong Kong's extraordinary journey over the past 20 years, to learn from our experience, and look forward to the future to ensure the stable development of 'one country, two systems,'"" he said in brief remarks before speeding off in a motorcade without answering questions. Hong Kongers have grown concerned Beijing is backtracking on ""one country, two systems"" following a string of recent incidents, most notably the secret detention of five Hong Kong booksellers on the mainland. Xi later visited the site of an arts hub under construction in West Kowloon district and was due to attend a banquet with government officials. On Friday, he's expected to inspect Chinese troops at a People's Liberation Army base. China's only aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, will pay its first Hong Kong port call to mark the PLA's 20 year-presence in the city, the Defense Ministry said. The ship, commissioned in 2012, and its battle group departed northern China on a training mission earlier this week and will likely pass through the Taiwan Strait along its voyage to Hong Kong. Speaking at a monthly news briefing, ministry spokesman Col. Wu Qian said the ship would take part in ""celebratory activities,"" but gave no details. Media reports said the ship would arrive in Hong Kong on July 7 for a two-day visit. ___ Associated Press writer Christopher Bodeen in Beijing contributed to this report.

216,AP PHOTOS: Xi cult of personality unseen in China since Mao,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5486783/AP-PHOTOS-Xi-cult-personality-unseen-China-Mao.html," 03:45 BST, 11 March 2018 "," BEIJING (AP) - President Xi Jinping, poised to rule over China indefinitely, is at the center of the Communist Party's most colorful efforts to build a cult of personality since the death of People's Republic founder Mao Zedong in 1976. Xi's image dominates the front pages of state newspapers, hours of state television broadcasts, magazine covers, posters sold at markets, billboards around parks and signs posted along sidewalks. On television, Xi is often depicted as being wildly adored by anyone from factory workers and farmers to space engineers and soldiers who typically applaud Xi for several minutes.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)  The effort has prompted memories of the upheaval of Mao's 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. Party spokespeople reject such talk, insisting Xi is the core of its seven-member Standing Committee, not a lone strongman. On Sunday, China's ceremonial legislature will likely approve a constitutional amendment to abolish term limits on the presidency, paving the way for Xi to rule indefinitely.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron issued a statement that contrasted with the position of U.S. President Donald Trump, who took his country out of the Paris climate accord partly because of concerns over how it threatened American business. Xi and Macron stressed ""the importance of reorienting public and private investment toward fighting climate change and protecting biodiversity,"" notably in developing countries where China is a major investor. They vowed support for the 2015 Paris agreement to reduce the emissions that cause global warming, including in the energy and refrigeration sectors.

218,Patten urges China not to see Hong Kongers as dissidents,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4902532/Patten-urges-China-not-Hong-Kongers-dissidents.html," 12:23 BST, 20 September 2017 "," HONG KONG (AP) - Hong Kong's last British governor urged Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday not to treat the city's residents like dissidents. Chris Patten's comments came amid flaring tensions over calls for independence on the semiautonomous region's college campuses. Patten was Britain's top official in Hong Kong until Beijing took control of the colony on July 1, 1997.          Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last British governor, pauses after an interview following a promotional event for his new book ""First Confession"" in Hong Kong, Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2017. Patten, has urged President Xi Jinping not to treat the Chinese-controlled city's residents like dissidents. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu)  In a speech during a visit to the city, Patten said he hopes Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who took office earlier this year, will advise Xi to refrain from taking a hard-line approach. ""I hope that she makes it clear to Beijing that talking about democracy in Hong Kong isn't an act of subversion,"" he said. ""I hope that she will be able to persuade President Xi that he shouldn't treat Hong Kong as though people in Hong Kong were just another group of dissidents out to create trouble. So she's got an extremely difficult job."" Hong Kong allows civil liberties unseen on mainland China, including freedom of speech. But the recent controversy over calls for independence has highlighted fears about threats to those liberties, by pitting student leaders against the city's Beijing-backed government and university officials, who say those sentiments are an abuse of those freedoms. Some activists began openly advocating the once-unthinkable idea of independence from mainland China after massive pro-democracy protests ended without resolution in 2014. Xi warned on a visit to the city earlier this year that talk of independence crosses one of Beijing's red lines and China's sovereignty over the city is not up for negotiation.

219,"Putin: Cooperation with China at ""unprecedented level""",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5820357/Putin-Xi-Beijing-meeting-underscores-close-relationship.html," 08:51 BST, 8 June 2018 "," BEIJING (AP) - Cooperation between Russia and China is at an all-time high, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Friday, underscoring how pressure from the West has magnified Beijing's political and economic importance to Moscow. ""Cooperation with China is one of Russia's top priorities and it has reached an unprecedented level,"" Putin said. Xi said the two countries have ""always firmly taken the development of relations as a priority direction.""          Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands during a signing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Friday, June 8, 2018. Cooperation between Russia and China is at an all-time high, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in a meeting Friday ahead of a summit featuring their two countries and six Asian states. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)  They have ""resolutely supported the other's core interests ... and jointly proactively participated in international affairs and global governance,"" Xi said. Following their talks, Xi presented Putin with China's newly created Friendship Medal at an elaborate ceremony. The two leaders also signed a statement saying that ""in conditions of a growing global instability and uncertainty"" Russia and China will ""deepen their consultations on strategic stability issues."" They vowed to ""expand counter-terrorism cooperation,"" boost contacts between their militaries and encourage joint international efforts to fight terrorism ""without any double standards."" The statement also criticized the U.S. decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and said they would endeavor to keep it alive and ensure further trade with Iran. Officials from the two nations signed a raft of agreements on cooperation in economic development, transport, space and nuclear energy. They included deals envisaging the construction of two more nuclear reactors at China's Tianwan nuclear power plant and more reactors at another location. An agreement was also reached for Russia to provide equipment and know-how for China to build an experimental fast neutron reactor. Russia and China have responded to the U.S. national security strategy describing them as America's top adversaries by vowing to further expand their economic, political and military cooperation. Putin has been driven closer to China by a sharp decline in relations with the West after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Moscow is increasingly looking to Beijing for trade and investment following waves of Western sanctions targeting its vital energy sector and military industries and limiting the country's access to global financial markets. China has come under growing criticism over its militarization of the South China Sea and accusations of unfair trading practices and human rights abuses. Along with closer bilateral ties, they have also sought to strengthen the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an eight-member regional grouping they created, which holds its annual summit in China this weekend. Putin's visit comes just a month since he began his new term in office. He and Xi have met 25 times - five times last year alone, according to Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov. Following a formal welcoming ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing, Putin first with Premier Li Keqiang, telling him that Russia-China trade and economic ties have ""gained a good tempo, and we are looking for new spheres of cooperation."" Li said bilateral trade is expected to reach $100 billion this year and voiced a readiness to expand cooperation in both traditional and new spheres, including nuclear energy. Bilateral trade shrank from nearly $100 billion in 2014 to some $60 billion the following year due to a sharp depreciation of the Russian currency. It has since partly recovered as the ruble has strengthened, reaching nearly $90 billion last year.

220,Putin says willing to meet Trump whenever US is ready,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5826081/Putin-criticizes-US-withdrawal-Iranian-nuclear-deal.html," 06:01 BST, 10 June 2018 "," QINGDAO, China (AP) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that he's happy to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump once Washington is ready to hold the summit and welcomed Trump's call to bring Moscow back into the G-7 group of leading industrialized nations. Speaking to reporters in Qingdao, China, Putin said that some nations, including Austria, have offered to host his summit with Trump, should they have one. ""The U.S. president has repeatedly said that it's reasonable to hold such a meeting,"" Putin said on the sidelines of a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. ""As soon as the U.S. side is ready, the meeting will take place, depending, of course, on my working schedule.""          Chinese President Xi Jinping, right, and Russian President Vladimir Putin pose for a photo at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in Qingdao in eastern China's Shandong Province Sunday, June 10, 2018. (Sergei Guneyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)  Putin said he shares Trump's expression of concern about a renewed arms race expressed in a March phone call. ""I can confirm that President Trump voiced concern about a new round of arms race in our latest call,"" Putin said. ""I fully agree with him,"" he said, adding that personal meetings and work by experts are needed to tackle the issue. Putin's remarks follow a report that White House officials were working toward setting up a meeting. Trump has said he was open to having a summit with Putin, who U.S. intelligence officials have said directed Russian meddling in the 2016 election to help Trump win. The American leader has repeatedly said he wants to improve relationships with Moscow. Putin also welcomed Trump's statement that Russia should be invited to rejoin the group that was called the G-8 before others expelled Russia. ""It wasn't us who left,"" he said. ""Colleagues refused to come to Russia on well-known grounds."" ""We will be ready to greet them all in Moscow,"" he added. Russia was expelled from the grouping in 2014 after it invaded and annexed Crimea and for its support for pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine. Trump, however, suggested that the G-7 offer a seat at the table to Russia. ""I think it would be an asset to have Russia back in,"" he said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he told Trump that readmitting Russia ""is not something that we are even remotely looking at at this time."" Putin also dismissed as mere ""chatter"" a G-7 statement that criticized Russia. The statement had said: ""We urge Russia to cease its destabilizing behavior to undermine democratic systems and its support of the Syrian regime."" It also said the countries shared and agreed with Britain's assessment that it is ""highly likely"" that Russia was responsible for the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain. ""Once again, nothing concrete was said,"" Putin said, referring to the G-7 statement. ""It's time to stop that chatter and deal with real issues."" Earlier Sunday, Putin criticized the U.S. withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal in a speech at the summit. He emphasized that the bloc's members, who also include China, four ex-Soviet Central Asian nations, as well as India and Pakistan, are worried about the U.S. move. Putin said that Washington's decision to exit the agreement could ""destabilize the situation"" in the region. He added that Moscow will continue to honor its obligations under the Iranian nuclear deal. Last month, Trump pulled out of former U.S. President Barack Obama's landmark 2015 nuclear accord with Iran over the objections of European allies and other nations. Addressing the summit, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, whose country has an observer status in the group, said that Iran would expect other participants in the nuclear deal to provide guarantees that they would honor the agreement. Founded in 2001, the Beijing-based SCO has largely served as a vehicle for resolving border issues, fighting terrorism and - more implicitly - to counter American influence in Central Asia following its invasion of Afghanistan.

221,"Italy, China deepen ties under wary gaze of US, EU",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6838089/Chinas-leader-visits-Italy-eye-infrastructure-deal.html," 07:39 BST, 22 March 2019 "," MILAN (AP) - Italy's head of state told visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday that China's new ""Silk Road"" linking Europe and Asia must be a ""two-way street,"" addressing concerns among Western allies that the colossal infrastructure project is meant merely to amplify Beijing's global influence. During Xi's two-day official state visit, Italy is expected to become the first major democracy to sign an agreement to join China's ""Belt and Road"" initiative. The program aims to invest in ports, roads, airports and railways in Asia, Africa and Europe to create a conduit for trade and China's construction industry. Both the United States and Italy's European partners, however, see it as a threat as China seeks to project its power. While Xi was getting the red-carpet honors in Rome, the European Union's leaders were in Brussels preparing a strategy to counter the growing influence of a China, described as a ""systemic rival."" The EU is, among other things, worried about unfair competition from Chinese companies, which are controlled by the Chinese government and benefit from the state's financial backing. The U.S., meanwhile, is in a trade war with China, imposing tariffs on billions of euros on each other's goods, and wants to limit China's ambitions to dominate future technologies, in particular the next-generation, superfast 5G networks. Critics say Chinese domination in 5G networks could allow it to snoop on global data. Both the U.S. and Europe also complain that China forces foreign companies to provide technological know-how in exchange for a presence in the country. Xi's visit to Italy is expected to produce dozens of deals worth billions of euros alongside the infrastructure framework covering cultural exchanges, sports cooperation and business deals. Officials have said China's participation in Italy's 5G networks is not on the table.          Chinese President Xi Jinping shakes hands with Italian President Sergio Mattarella during a business forum inside the Quirinale Presidential, in Rome, Friday, March 22, 2019. Mattarella told visiting President Jinping on Friday that China's new ""Silk Road"" linking Europe and Asia must be a ""two-way street,"" addressing concerns among Western allies that the colossal infrastructure project is meant merely to amplify Beijing's influence in the region. (Tiziana Fabi/Pool Photo via AP)  Mattarella told a joint press conference with Xi that the infrastructure initiative is ""the ideal framework for increasing joint collaboration,"" to stimulate Chinese investments in Italy and open the Chinese market to Italian exports. But he also addressed concerns that China's state apparatus would be the real winner. ""The old Silk Road was an instrument of knowledge among peoples, of sharing, and of mutual discoveries. So, too, the new one must be a two-way street, along which travel not only merchandise but also ideas, talents, knowledge, long-term solutions to common problems and future projects,"" Mattarella said. He said both countries could reap the benefits of economic cooperation ""founded on fair competition, respecting industrial and intellectual property and in the common fight against counterfeiting."" Xi told reporters that the importance of China's relationship with Italy went beyond bilateral ties. ""China appreciates Italy's willingness to play a positive role in developing a healthy and stable China-Europe relationship,"" Xi said. Xi and his wife, Peng Liuan, were greeted with full honors in the courtyard of the presidential palace, overseen by the regal guard while a band played the Chinese and Italian anthems. Xi later attended a wreath-laying ceremony at Italy's monument for the unknown soldier, and visited parliament and was scheduled to attend a state dinner where Andrea Bocelli will perform. The state visit, reciprocating one by Mattarella two years ago, was being held under maximum security, with large swaths of Rome closed. But the centerpiece of the visit will be Saturday's signing of a memorandum of understanding to make Italy the first Group of Seven and core EU nation to join China's ""Belt and Road"" project, which has so far seen investments totaling more than a trillion dollars. Since Xi announced the ambitious project in 2013, it has been hit by complaints that it saddles participating countries with debt while doing little to boost local economies. Projects in Nepal, Hungary and Myanmar have been cancelled or stalled as a result of either financing difficulties or violations of local regulations. In Brussels, French leader Emmanuel Macron called for a concerted EU approach to China, criticizing Italy's singular move in agreeing to sign the deal with China. ""I believe that holding bilateral talks on the New Silk Road initiative is not a good method,"" Macron said. ""We won't proceed like that."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed it would ""be better if we act uniformly."" She said it was important that Europe make it clear in discussions with China of the need for reciprocal market access. She noted there have been some signs of progress, with some German companies now allowed to own more than 49 percent of joint ventures in China. China expert Francesco Sisci said Mattarella's comments indicate ""that he fears there hasn't been enough transparency so far in relations between China and Italy. Allies may also have expressed to him their worries about how Italy is managing the new relationship with China."" ""The accent is that Italy risks becoming a Trojan horse for the Chinese invasion,"" he said. Sisci noted Italy's contrasting interests, between its ties to Western allies, and its ambition to become a bridge linking to Asia and Africa, while expanding its footprint in the huge Chinese market. Chinese investments in Italy have totaled 22 billion euros ($25 billion), officials say, well below that of other European nations. Britain, for example, has received investments worth 80 billion euros. Italian exports into China lag other nations by a decade or more, running at 13 billion euros compared with 20 billion euros for France and 87 billion euros for Germany. ___ Sam Petrequin in Brussels and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.

222,Shanghai Disneyland opens with hopes cash will rain down,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3644832/Shanghai-Disneyland-opens-hopes-cash-rain-down.html," 13:51 BST, 16 June 2016 ","Shanghai Disneyland opens with hopes cash will rain down By Associated Press   Published: 13:51 BST, 16 June 2016  |  Updated: 13:53 BST, 16 June 2016                e-mail         SHANGHAI (AP) — Walt Disney Co. opened Shanghai Disneyland, its first theme park in mainland China, with a lavish celebration Thursday featuring Communist Party leaders, a children's choir, Sleeping Beauty and other Disney characters.A vice premier joined Disney CEO Bob Iger in cutting the grand opening's red ribbon, showing the ruling party's support for the $5.5 billion investment in promoting tourism at a time of slowing economic growth. They read letters of congratulations from the Chinese and American presidents, Xi Jinping and Barack Obama.""This is one of the proudest and most exciting moments in the history of the Walt Disney Co.,"" Iger said after the choir sang. Later, actors dressed as Sleeping Beauty, Donald Duck and other Disney characters danced on stage.

Walt Disney Co. opened its first theme park in mainland China on Thursday at a ceremony that mixed speeches by Communist Party officials, a Chinese children's choir and actors dressed as Sleeping Beauty and other Disney characters. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) The company hopes Shanghai Disneyland will burnish the brand behind ""Frozen"" in the world's most populous film market and help revive Disney's struggling international theme park business.Analysts expect Shanghai Disneyland to become the world's most-visited theme park, attracting at least 15 million and as many as 50 million guests a year. By contrast, Walt Disney World drew 19.3 million people in 2014.Speaking as a light rain fell, Vice Premier Wang Yang quipped, ""I would like to call this a rain of U.S. dollars or of renminbi,"" the Chinese currency.Wang, a member of the ruling party's Politiburo, described the park as an example of Sino-U.S. ""practical cooperation"" and ""people to people exchanges.""The festive sentiment was tempered by news from Florida that an alligator killed a 2-year-old boy at Disney's flagship Walt Disney World. The boy drowned after the animal dragged him into a lagoon on Tuesday.Despite slower growth, China's economy still is one of the world's best-performing and tourism spending is rising.Shanghai represents a market of 300 million people living within three hours of the park by car or train in one of China's most affluent regions. China's bullet train network can draw in areas further afield.YouGov, a market research firm, said 44 percent of people it surveyed in China in May said they plan to visit Shanghai Disneyland within a year. It said 80 percent plan to take family members.""I think it's really lively here and every girl can realize her dream of becoming a princess,"" said Gong Haiyan, a visitor from western China's Sichuan province.Wang Lei, 34, said she liked the park, despite long waits for some things.""I'm sure I will go again, maybe again and again,"" said Wang, a buyer for a Shanghai food chain. ""I'll bring my kids and relatives from my hometown.""Chinese are not cutting back on tourism despite the weak economy, said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research in Shanghai.""They are still spending on experiences and on their kids,"" Rein said. ""It's going to be a huge success. Everybody in China who has a kid or a grandkid is going to want to go to Shanghai Disney.""Disney's opening follows a decade of negotiations, five years of construction and weeks of testing. Iger said more than 1 million visitors already have tried out its rides, shops, restaurants and two hotels.Global brands like Disney are rushing to create products for Chinese tastes.The company added China-themed elements and put the emphasis on popular characters at the Shanghai park, while downplaying its American identity. At the entrance, instead of ""Main Street USA,"" it's ""Mickey Avenue.""Near its iconic Storybook Castle, Disney created a ""Garden of the Twelve Friends"" using characters such as Remy from ""Ratatouille"" and Tigger from ""Winnie the Pooh"" as animals of the Chinese Zodiac. Disney says the Wandering Moon Teahouse, modeled on a building in eastern China, is the only Chinese-style structure in any of its parks.The park should generate some $1.5 billion to $4.5 billion a year in revenue, according to Drexel Hamilton analyst Tony Wible. However, Disney's state-owned Chinese partner, the Shanghai Shendi (Group) Co. Ltd., which owns 57 percent of the 7.5-square-kilometer (2.9-square-mile) park, will get the lion's share.Disney's international parks in Paris, Hong Kong and Tokyo haven't made a profit in six of the past 10 years, Wible figures. So the main advantage of the huge park may be promotion of the brand and merchandise.Disney has many inexperienced but ambitious competitors in China.The country's biggest developer, Wanda Group, opened a 20 billion yuan ($3 billion) entertainment complex in the southern city of Nanchang in May and said it plans more. It bought Hollywood studio Legendary Entertainment in January, and Wanda founder Wang Jianlin, Asia's second-richest businessman, said he hopes to surpass Disney as the biggest global tourism company by 2020,China is a challenging environment in other ways, with official controls on business activities and on taking profits out of the country. Live shows such as Disney's ""Lion King"" musical must be approved by Chinese censors.Disney's DisneyLife direct-to-consumer online movie and book offering was closed in April, five months after opening, amid a Chinese regulatory review.In the Shanghai park, Disney needs its Chinese partner's approval to change restaurant prices and other management details.""They are hamstrung in a lot of areas,"" said Rein. But still, he said, Shanghai Disneyland ""is far above anything else in China.""One big risk is that the park will prove so popular potential visitors may be put off by the crowds.Jin Yasi, a 33-year-old housewife from Wuhan, came with her husband and their two daughters, aged 6 and 3, dressed as Elsa from ""Frozen"" and as Snow White. Jin said she has visited Hong Kong Disneyland, the company's first park in Greater China, three times.""The castle is definitely great,"" Jin said. But after waiting an hour to get through a security check, she said, ""I think they should offer better service.""___McDonald reported from Beijing.

223,China's 'space dream': A Long March to the moon,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5568809/Chinas-space-dream-A-Long-March-moon.html," 06:22 BST, 2 April 2018 ","          The Tiangong-1 was shot into orbit in September 2011  The plunge back to Earth of a defunct Chinese space laboratory will not slow down Beijing's ambitious plans to send humans to the moon. The Tiangong-1 space module, which crashed Monday, was intended to serve as a stepping stone to a manned station, but its problems highlight the difficulties of exploring outer space. But China has come a long way in its race to catch up with the United States and Russia, which have lost spacecraft, astronauts and cosmonauts over the decades. China's ""taikonauts"" have fared better and Beijing sees its military-run space programme as a marker of its rising global stature and growing technological might. Here is a look at China's space endeavour through the decades, and where it is headed: Mao's vow Soon after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957, Chairman Mao Zedong pronounced ""We too will make satellites."" It took more than a decade but in 1970 China's first satellite lifted into space on the back of a Long March rocket. Human space flight took decades longer, with the first successful mission coming in 2003. As the launch of astronaut Yang Liwei into orbit approached, angst over the viability of the mission caused Beijing to cancel a nationwide live television broadcast at the last minute. Despite the suspense, it went off smoothly, with Yang orbiting the Earth 14 times during his 21-hour flight aboard the Shenzhou 5. Since then China has sent men and women into space with increasing regularity. Space station and 'Jade Rabbit' Following in the footsteps of the United States and Russia, China is striving to open a space station circling our planet. The Tiangong-1 was shot into orbit in September 2011. In 2013, the second Chinese woman in space, Wang Yaping, gave a video class from inside the space module beamed back to children across the world's most populous country.          The Jade Rabbit lunar rover surveyed the moon's surface for 31 months  The lab was also used for medical experiments and, most importantly, tests intended to prepare for the building of a space station. The lab was followed by the ""Jade Rabbit"" lunar rover in 2013 which looked at first like a dud when it turned dormant and stopped sending signals back to Earth. The rover made a dramatic recovery, though, ultimately surveying the moon's surface for 31 months, well beyond its expected lifespan. In 2016, China launched its second station, the Tiangong-2 lab into orbit 393 kilometres (244 miles) above Earth, in what analysts say will likely serve as a final building block before China launches a manned space station. Astronauts who have visited the station have run experiments on growing rice and thale cress and docking spacecraft. 'Space dream' Under President Xi Jinping, plans for China's ""space dream"", as he calls it, have been put into overdrive. The new superpower is looking to finally catch up with the US and Russia after years of belatedly matching their space milestones. The ambitions start with a space station of its own, slated to begin assembling pieces in space in 2020 with manned use to start around 2022 -- China was deliberately left out of the International Space Station effort. China is also planning to build a base on the moon, the state-run Global Times said in early March, citing the Communist Party chief of the China Academy of Space Technology.          China has been carrying out experiments in a lab simulating a lunar-like environment in preparation for its long-term goal of putting humans on the moon  The outpost will initially be controlled by artificial intelligence robots until humans are sent to occasionally manage it, the official said. But lunar work was dealt a setback last year when the Long March-5 Y2, a powerful heavy-lift rocket, failed to launch in July on a mission to send communication satellites into orbit. The failure forced the postponement of the launch of lunar probe Chang'e-5, originally scheduled to collect moon samples in the second half of 2017. The official Xinhua news agency quoted a China Lunar Exploration Programme designer as saying last week that the Chang'e 5 is now slated to land in 2019 and then bring back moon samples to Earth. Another robot, the Chang'e-4, is still due to land in 2018 for the ""first-ever soft landing and roving survey on the far side of the moon"", said Zuo Wei, deputy chief designer of the CLEP Ground Application System. China's astronauts and scientists have also talked up manned missions to Mars as it strives to become a ""global space power""."
224,"After decades of mistrust, Pope pushes for breakthrough with China",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3690211/After-decades-mistrust-Pope-pushes-breakthrough-China.html," 13:00 BST, 15 July 2016 ","After decades of mistrust, Pope pushes for breakthrough with China By Reuters   Published: 13:00 BST, 15 July 2016  |  Updated: 13:00 BST, 15 July 2016                e-mail        5 shares    By Lisa Jucca, Benjamin Kang Lim and Greg TorodeHONG KONG/BEIJING, July 14 (Reuters) - Pope Francis is leading a determined push to fundamentally alter the relationship between the Vatican and China, which for decades has been infused with mutual suspicion and acrimony.Interviews with some two dozen Catholic officials and clergy in Hong Kong, Italy and mainland China, as well as sources with ties to the leadership in Beijing, reveal details of an agreement that would fall short of full diplomatic ties but would address key issues at the heart of the bitter divide between the Vatican and Beijing.A working group with members from both sides was set up in April and is discussing how to resolve a core disagreement over who has the authority to select and ordain bishops in China, several of the sources told Reuters. The group is also trying to settle a dispute over eight bishops who were appointed by Beijing but did not get papal approval - an act of defiance in the eyes of the Vatican.In what would be a dramatic breakthrough, the pope is preparing to pardon the eight, possibly as early as this summer, paving the way to further detente, say Catholic sources with knowledge of the deliberations.A signal of Francis' deep desire for rapprochement with China came last year in the form of a behind-the-scenes effort by the Vatican to engineer the first-ever meeting between the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the leader of the Chinese Communist Party. Aides to the pope tried to arrange a meeting when both Francis and Chinese President Xi Jinping were in New York in late September to address the United Nations General Assembly.The meeting didn't happen. But the overture didn't go unnoticed in Beijing.While the two sides have said they are discussing the issue of the bishops, Catholic sources gave Reuters the most detailed account yet of the negotiations and the secret steps the Vatican has taken to pave the way to a deal.The current talks come more than six decades after victorious Communist Party leaders, having vanquished the Nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek, expelled Vatican envoy Antonio Riberi from Beijing in 1951 as they banished missionaries and began a crackdown on organized religion. The Vatican remains the only Western state that does not have diplomatic ties with Beijing, maintaining instead formal relations with the Republic of China, based in Taiwan, which Beijing views as a renegade province.For the Vatican, a thaw in relations with China offers the prospect of easing the plight of Christians on the mainland who for decades have been persecuted by the authorities. It may also ultimately pave the way to diplomatic relations, giving the Church full access to the world's most populous nation.An official relationship with China ""would crown a dream that the Catholic Church has cultivated for many centuries: to establish a regular presence in China through stable diplomatic ties,"" said Elisa Giunipero, a researcher at the Catholic University of Milan who has studied the history of the Catholic Church in China for 20 years.For China, improved relations could burnish its international image and soften criticism of its human rights record. It would also be an important step in prizing the Vatican away from Taiwan, handing China an important diplomatic victory in its efforts to isolate the self-governing island.Spokespeople for the two sides acknowledged the talks are continuing but declined to answer detailed questions about them.""The aim of the contacts between the Holy See and Chinese representatives is not primarily that of establishing diplomatic relations, but that of facilitating the life of the Church and contributing to making relations in ecclesial life normal and serene,"" Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi told Reuters.""We are willing, on the basis of the relevant principles, to continue having constructive dialogue with the Vatican side, to meet each other halfway and jointly promote the continued forward development of the process of improving bilateral ties,"" China's Foreign Ministry said. ""(We) hope the Vatican can likewise take a flexible and pragmatic attitude and create beneficial conditions for improving bilateral relations.""A PAPAL INVITEForging an agreement won't be easy. There is resistance on both sides.Among Chinese leaders, there is concern that a deal would give the Vatican a powerful foothold on the mainland, challenging the Communist Party's absolute authority.In the ""underground"" church in China, whose members have been systematically persecuted for decades by the authorities, many devotees may feel betrayed by a Vatican deal with Beijing. Catholic clergy belonging to the underground church have been detained and jailed through the years, and several bishops have died in prison, according to Catholic sources who monitor the situation on the mainland.The Catholic Church in China, where there are an estimated eight to 10 million devotees, is divided into two communities: the ""official"" church, which is represented by the state-sanctioned Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, and the ""underground"" church, which swears allegiance solely to the pope in Rome. Scholars estimate the number of Christians in China belonging to all denominations may be as many as 70 million.Despite resistance in some quarters of the Catholic Church, including in Hong Kong, Pope Francis has made improved ties with China a priority, and a tight-knit circle of envoys and advisers around the pontiff are working on a deal, multiple sources told Reuters.After he was elected pope in March 2013, Francis sent a message to Xi congratulating him on having become president of China. Then, while flying over China in August 2014 on the way to Seoul - the first time Beijing had allowed a pope to enter its airspace - the pope sent his best wishes to Xi and the Chinese people. The next month, Francis sent a letter to Xi via Argentinean politician Ricardo Romano, who had met the future pope when Francis was the archbishop of Buenos Aires, inviting the Chinese leader to a meeting, Romano told Reuters.In early February this year, the pope sent wishes to Xi for the Chinese New Year, the country's most important holiday. And on his way back to Rome from Mexico two weeks later, the pope told a news conference on the plane that he would ""really love"" to visit China.NEW YORK RENDEZVOUSAn early indication that Pope Francis was serious about improving relations with China was his appointment in August 2013 of then Archbishop Pietro Parolin as his Secretary of State, the highest ranking diplomat in the Vatican. Under Pope Benedict XVI, Francis' predecessor, Parolin had been the Vatican's chief negotiator with Beijing and was near to hammering out a deal with China on the appointment of bishops in 2009, people with direct knowledge of those negotiations say.""In 2009, Parolin came very close to an agreement (with China),"" said Agostino Giovagnoli, a professor of contemporary history at the Catholic University of Milan who closely follows the Vatican's relationship with China.Ultimately, an agreement on the bishops wasn't reached as the Vatican considered it too narrow, say Catholic Church sources.Parolin then moved to Venezuela in 2009 as the Vatican's representative there. His departure marked the start of a period of chilly relations with China.In June 2014, the sides restarted contacts with a meeting in Rome, according to a Catholic official. A year later, the Vatican made its attempt to get Francis and Xi Jinping together in New York.The pope was scheduled to fly from New York to Philadelphia on the morning of Sept. 26 last year, departing from John F. Kennedy Airport, his itinerary shows. Xi was heading to New York from Washington. The airport, three Catholic officials told Reuters, could have provided a discreet venue for a meeting between the two leaders, away from the media glare.Catholic officials and clergy, and sources in China with knowledge of the contacts, offer differing accounts of why the leaders ultimately didn't meet, but all agree that the pope wanted to meet Xi and that this message was communicated clearly to China.According to a Chinese source with direct knowledge of the matter, Beijing ""could not make up its mind whether it should take place before or after the signing of an agreement.""In October, though, a six-person Vatican delegation made a visit to Beijing, followed by another meeting in January. A breakthrough came in April this year when the sides agreed to set up a working group, according to two Catholic Church officials. The group is modeled on the Joint Liaison Group that Britain and China adopted to iron out issues before the handover of Hong Kong to the mainland in 1997, according to one of the officials.The pope, says one Catholic official, has given ""clear instructions to continue the dialogue (with China) and find a resolution.""The working group, which met in May, has been charged with hammering out technical solutions to the dispute over the ordination of bishops in China. It is currently discussing how to resolve the issue of eight bishops who were ordained in China without papal consent, according to Church officials and other Catholic sources with knowledge of the deliberations. Going forward, the Holy See wants to prevent a situation in which bishops are appointed by an authority other than the pope.EXCOMMUNICATED BISHOPSCatholic officials say there are 110 bishops in China, most of whom have been sanctioned by the Communist Party. There are about 30 bishops who are part of the underground church and have pledged allegiance only to the pope.Most of the bishops recognized by Beijing have also sought the pope's blessing and received it. But there are eight bishops who were ordained in China and don't have papal approval. They are considered illegitimate by the Vatican.Three bishops in this group of eight have been officially excommunicated by the Vatican, according to public statements issued by the Holy See. The other five were told through informal channels that the pope opposed their ordination as bishops, according to Catholic sources.The issue is further complicated by the fact that at least two of the eight bishops allegedly have children or girlfriends, according to two Catholic sources. That's a direct affront to the celibacy pledge taken by Catholic priests. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the personal status of these bishops.Catholic Church officials and Catholic clergy with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters that the pope is preparing to pardon these eight bishops. The papal pardon would coincide with the Jubilee of Mercy, a year in which Catholics are urged to seek forgiveness for their offenses and forgive those who have offended them. The Vatican hopes a pardon would be interpreted by China as a goodwill gesture.""I believe Pope Francis wishes to use the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy to force a breakthrough,"" says Father Jeroom Heyndrickx, a Belgian missionary and member of the Vatican Commission for the Church in China, which was set up under Pope Benedict to advise the Holy See on relations with China. The jubilee year ends in November.The eight bishops whom the Vatican considers illegitimate can be readmitted to the Catholic Church if they receive a papal pardon. By the end of June, two out of the eight had not yet sent Francis a clear request for pardon, Catholic Church officials said.Since the Vatican does not consider these eight bishops fit to run a diocese, the two sides are discussing a possible compromise that would allow them to retain their titles but be assigned to other tasks, according to Catholic officials.Chen Jianming, director of the foreign affairs office of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, told Reuters it would be difficult to arrange interviews with any of its bishops. ""They're very busy people, often out in the field. Interviews would be very difficult,"" Chen said.The Patriotic Association and the State Administration for Religious Affairs in Beijing did not respond to questions from Reuters about the negotiations with the Vatican.A BISHOP'S CHANGE OF HEARTThe joint working group is also discussing another vexing issue - a mechanism whereby new bishops will be selected. The sides have failed to resolve this matter in nearly 30 years of on-off contacts. Attempts to find a solution under Benedict and Pope John Paul II failed.In line with centuries of Catholic tradition, bishops are appointed by the pope. But China adopts a model whereby bishops are chosen by the local Chinese clergy, who are members of the Communist Party-controlled Patriotic Association.Under a solution currently being discussed, the bishops would be selected by the clergy in China. The pope would have the power to veto candidates he considers unfit, but the Vatican would need to provide evidence that the person in question is unqualified for the position, according to Catholic Church officials and clergy. A key concern for Rome is that priests in China could face pressure or be offered inducements to favor candidates.A source in Beijing with ties to the leadership said the sides have reached a tentative agreement on the future appointment of bishops, but did not provide details.If a deal can be forged on the selection of new bishops, the Vatican then hopes to focus on an agreement that would see Beijing recognize the bishops who are members of the underground church.A sudden reversal last month by a high-profile Chinese bishop underscores the sensitivity of this issue. Thaddeus Ma Daqin, the auxiliary bishop of Shanghai, angered Beijing when he announced that he couldn't remain in the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association at his ordination ceremony in 2012. But Ma, who has since been under house arrest at the Sheshan mountain seminary on the outskirts of Shanghai, wrote in a June 12 blog post that in retrospect, the move had been ""unwise.""It is unclear why Ma recanted, but some Catholic officials are concerned that the bishop was pressured into making the statement by the Chinese authorities. That could be interpreted as an affront to the pope, one Catholic official told Reuters. Other Catholic sources speculated that Ma may have acted voluntarily in an effort to defuse his confrontation with Beijing and help smooth the way to a deal.The Chinese authorities did not reply to questions from Reuters about Ma's decision.FEAR OF FOREIGN INFLUENCEIn his effort to forge a breakthrough with China, Pope Francis will have to overcome deep-seated fears. China views the Church with suspicion, says the source in Beijing with ties to the Chinese leadership. For the Communist Party, which is officially atheist but recognizes five religions - Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Protestantism and Catholicism - the existence of a religion that recognizes a foreign leader as its moral authority is viewed as a potential threat.Communist Party leaders, who were traumatized by the disintegration of the Soviet Union, are acutely aware of the role played by the Catholic Church in the fall of communist regimes, such as the 1989 revolution in Poland, the homeland of the late Pope John Paul II.Within China there are also competing forces that could trip up an agreement, say Chinese and Catholic officials. The Foreign Ministry views détente with the Holy See as a way to isolate Taiwan, as the Vatican would likely have to sever ties to Taipei in the event of full diplomatic relations with Beijing. But the United Front Work Department, a party body whose mission is to spread China's influence, is less enthusiastic, fearing the threat of foreign religious infiltration.""Internally, there is division over whether the Pope can be trusted or not,"" says the source with leadership ties.For centuries, the Catholic Church has struggled to make inroads in China, where foreign influence, including Christianity, has been met with suspicion. That distrust erupted at the turn of the 20th century with the outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion, which targeted foreigners, including Christian missionaries, as well as Chinese Christians.But relations have not always been fraught. Matteo Ricci, a Jesuit like Pope Francis who arrived in the country in the late 16th century, embraced Chinese culture and became fluent in Mandarin, earning him access to the court of Ming dynasty Emperor Wanli. Ricci, who died in 1610, was buried in Beijing with the approval of the emperor.In some quarters of the church, there are varying degrees of opposition to a deal with China. While Parolin is spearheading the drive for an agreement, the Vatican department in charge of foreign missionary work is more cautious about a deal, according to Catholic sources.'WE NEED TO FOLLOW THE POPE'Criticism is especially strong in Hong Kong which, along with Macau, has long served as a beachhead for Catholicism on the mainland. The former British colony is home to missions and clergy that maintain extensive networks among both foreign and Chinese priests working in China, many underground.The most outspoken opponent is Cardinal Joseph Zen, a former bishop of Hong Kong, who is a member of the Commission for the Catholic Church in China, the advisory body set up by Benedict. Some members of the commission opposed the draft deal the Vatican hammered out with China in 2009, according to several people with knowledge of the deliberations.""The Chinese government has no intention to give in on anything,"" Zen, a respected figure in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, told Reuters.Under Francis, the commission has been sidelined. While it hasn't been dismantled, the body hasn't convened since he became pope. And the talks with China are being led by Rome-based Vatican officials.""Chinese Catholics want to be reunited in a single church,"" said a Chinese bishop who was appointed by Beijing and is also recognized by the pope. ""But it is difficult to think of a deal that could satisfy everyone.""Some members of the underground church, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, are especially dubious about a deal with China. Many have faced harsh persecution. Catholic clergy are closely watched by Chinese security forces, and priests have been pressured to register with the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, Catholic sources say.China Aid, a Texas-based group that monitors the government's treatment of all Christian denominations in China, said in its 2015 annual report that repression by the Chinese state had escalated. In areas where state repression was particularly strong, it pointed to the forcible closure of secretive house churches, the detention of ""large numbers of pastors, church leaders and Christians,"" and the confiscation of church property.China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions about religious persecution.Bishops in the underground church have been jailed and subjected to forced labor, according to reports in the Catholic media. Shi Enxiang, the underground bishop of Yixian in northeast China, died last year after having been detained in 2001, according to UCANews, a Catholic news service focused on Asia. The bishop, who was 94, had been confined to prison or labor camp for about half his life, UCANews said.""A full reconciliation needs time. If you go too fast, some segments of the underground Church could feel betrayed,"" says Antonio Sergianni, a former Vatican official who worked on the China desk in Rome for 10 years until 2013. ""But if the pope shows a new path, we need to follow the pope."" (Reporting by Lisa Jucca, Benjamin Kang Lim and Greg Torode.

226,"After decades of mistrust, Pope pushes for breakthrough with China",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3695004/After-decades-mistrust-Pope-pushes-breakthrough-China.html," 02:42 BST, 18 July 2016 ","After decades of mistrust, Pope pushes for breakthrough with China By Reuters   Published: 02:42 BST, 18 July 2016  |  Updated: 02:43 BST, 18 July 2016                e-mail         By Lisa Jucca, Benjamin Kang Lim and Greg TorodeHONG KONG/BEIJING, July 14 (Reuters) - Pope Francis is leading a determined push to fundamentally alter the relationship between the Vatican and China, which for decades has been infused with mutual suspicion and acrimony.Interviews with some two dozen Catholic officials and clergy in Hong Kong, Italy and mainland China, as well as sources with ties to the leadership in Beijing, reveal details of an agreement that would fall short of full diplomatic ties but would address key issues at the heart of the bitter divide between the Vatican and Beijing.A working group with members from both sides was set up in April and is discussing how to resolve a core disagreement over who has the authority to select and ordain bishops in China, several of the sources told Reuters. The group is also trying to settle a dispute over eight bishops who were appointed by Beijing but did not get papal approval - an act of defiance in the eyes of the Vatican.In what would be a dramatic breakthrough, the pope is preparing to pardon the eight, possibly as early as this summer, paving the way to further detente, say Catholic sources with knowledge of the deliberations.A signal of Francis' deep desire for rapprochement with China came last year in the form of a behind-the-scenes effort by the Vatican to engineer the first-ever meeting between the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the leader of the Chinese Communist Party. Aides to the pope tried to arrange a meeting when both Francis and Chinese President Xi Jinping were in New York in late September to address the United Nations General Assembly.The meeting didn't happen. But the overture didn't go unnoticed in Beijing.While the two sides have said they are discussing the issue of the bishops, Catholic sources gave Reuters the most detailed account yet of the negotiations and the secret steps the Vatican has taken to pave the way to a deal.The current talks come more than six decades after victorious Communist Party leaders, having vanquished the Nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek, expelled Vatican envoy Antonio Riberi from Beijing in 1951 as they banished missionaries and began a crackdown on organized religion. The Vatican remains the only Western state that does not have diplomatic ties with Beijing, maintaining instead formal relations with the Republic of China, based in Taiwan, which Beijing views as a renegade province.For the Vatican, a thaw in relations with China offers the prospect of easing the plight of Christians on the mainland who for decades have been persecuted by the authorities. It may also ultimately pave the way to diplomatic relations, giving the Church full access to the world's most populous nation.An official relationship with China ""would crown a dream that the Catholic Church has cultivated for many centuries: to establish a regular presence in China through stable diplomatic ties,"" said Elisa Giunipero, a researcher at the Catholic University of Milan who has studied the history of the Catholic Church in China for 20 years.For China, improved relations could burnish its international image and soften criticism of its human rights record. It would also be an important step in prizing the Vatican away from Taiwan, handing China an important diplomatic victory in its efforts to isolate the self-governing island.Spokespeople for the two sides acknowledged the talks are continuing but declined to answer detailed questions about them.""The aim of the contacts between the Holy See and Chinese representatives is not primarily that of establishing diplomatic relations, but that of facilitating the life of the Church and contributing to making relations in ecclesial life normal and serene,"" Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi told Reuters.""We are willing, on the basis of the relevant principles, to continue having constructive dialogue with the Vatican side, to meet each other halfway and jointly promote the continued forward development of the process of improving bilateral ties,"" China's Foreign Ministry said. ""(We) hope the Vatican can likewise take a flexible and pragmatic attitude and create beneficial conditions for improving bilateral relations.""A PAPAL INVITEForging an agreement won't be easy. There is resistance on both sides.Among Chinese leaders, there is concern that a deal would give the Vatican a powerful foothold on the mainland, challenging the Communist Party's absolute authority.In the ""underground"" church in China, whose members have been systematically persecuted for decades by the authorities, many devotees may feel betrayed by a Vatican deal with Beijing. Catholic clergy belonging to the underground church have been detained and jailed through the years, and several bishops have died in prison, according to Catholic sources who monitor the situation on the mainland.The Catholic Church in China, where there are an estimated eight to 10 million devotees, is divided into two communities: the ""official"" church, which is represented by the state-sanctioned Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, and the ""underground"" church, which swears allegiance solely to the pope in Rome. Scholars estimate the number of Christians in China belonging to all denominations may be as many as 70 million.Despite resistance in some quarters of the Catholic Church, including in Hong Kong, Pope Francis has made improved ties with China a priority, and a tight-knit circle of envoys and advisers around the pontiff are working on a deal, multiple sources told Reuters.After he was elected pope in March 2013, Francis sent a message to Xi congratulating him on having become president of China. Then, while flying over China in August 2014 on the way to Seoul - the first time Beijing had allowed a pope to enter its airspace - the pope sent his best wishes to Xi and the Chinese people. The next month, Francis sent a letter to Xi via Argentinean politician Ricardo Romano, who had met the future pope when Francis was the archbishop of Buenos Aires, inviting the Chinese leader to a meeting, Romano told Reuters.In early February this year, the pope sent wishes to Xi for the Chinese New Year, the country's most important holiday. And on his way back to Rome from Mexico two weeks later, the pope told a news conference on the plane that he would ""really love"" to visit China.NEW YORK RENDEZVOUSAn early indication that Pope Francis was serious about improving relations with China was his appointment in August 2013 of then Archbishop Pietro Parolin as his Secretary of State, the highest ranking diplomat in the Vatican.

227,Football: China dare to believe despite World Cup exit,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4860452/Football-China-dare-believe-despite-World-Cup-exit.html," 05:20 BST, 7 September 2017 ","          No caption  Marcello Lippi is slowly beginning to make China believe they can become a footballing power, despite another failure to reach the World Cup finals. Since his appointment as head coach in October 2016 with China rock bottom of their Asian zone World Cup qualifying group, the Italian has presided over a resurgence that saw just one defeat in six matches, 1-0 away to runaway group winners Iran. Back-to-back wins to finish the campaign, at home to Uzbekistan and a comeback 2-1 win when down to 10 men at 2022 hosts Qatar on Tuesday, have sent a wave of cautious optimism across fans and officials. It was not enough for the world's most populous nation to continue on the path to Russia next year as they fell just one point short of reaching the playoffs. But it was enough to keep alive the dream of one day again reaching the finals and of fulfilling the ambition of China's President Xi Jinping to host the global showpiece.          No caption  ""Since Marcello Lippi has been leading the team, the changes have been huge,"" said Chinese Football Association president Cai Zhenhua of the man who led Italy to World Cup victory in 2006. ""The most noticeable is that the players are now able to express themselves on the pitch and that their confidence is growing. ""The ability of the players to carry out the coach's plans and tactics has clearly improved."" - Lack of passion - Still many pundits contend that the national team's ambitions will continue to be hampered by mediocre coaching, poor funding choices and lack of passion at the grassroots.          No caption  Chinese Super League clubs splashing huge amounts of cash to import foreign strikers such as Oscar, Carlos Tevez and Alexandre Pato does not help. Angela Smith, head of international projects at English Premier League club Stoke City, who have opened academies in China, said while Chinese clubs are ""buying strikers, they are not thinking about the development of the whole team"". ""If you don't develop the whole team, you are just constantly going to be paying money out to other countries, and the game will never develop from the grassroots levels in clubs and academies,"" she said. China aspires to have 40,000 football schools by 2020, up from the current 13,000. But all the academies in the world will not be enough if youngsters lack passion, according to Luiz Ferreira, the Portuguese director of youth training at Chinese Super League (CSL) club Tianjin Teda. ""During a training session, I asked my young players: 'How many of you watched the Champions League final?' It was just one out of three. They just don't care about it,"" he said. He added that it would probably ""need time"" to develop a deep-seated love for the game as found in Europe and South America. The country is no longer hiding the desire to host the FIFA World Cup in 2030, for which Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have just submitted a joint bid. However China languishes at 77th place in FIFA's world rankings, just behind Sierra Leone, and only eighth in Asia. - Upbeat assessment - Football in China has been overseen by the Communist regime since the 1950s, and only really took off in the middle of the 1990s, with the creation of professional clubs. Mads Davidsen, technical director of CSL Shanghai SIPG, said it could be another 15-20 years before China can compete with the world's best. Davidsen said he had recently attended a football training session in China for eight-year-olds where ""the level of the players was at least at the same level as I have seen in Europe -- maybe even better.          China's Gao Lin celebrates after scoring against Uzbekistan on August 31, 2017.  ""Good training is therefore taking place from the earliest stage. Considering that 28 years is the best football age, China still needs 15-20 years to have a competitive national team,"" he added. China have only made it to the World Cup once, in 2002, when they failed to win a point or even score a goal. But under the wily 69-year-old Lippi, who has pledged to stay through to the 2019 Asian Cup, there are signs that China are on an upward trajectory at last with newspapers delivering upbeat assessments after the World Cup exit. ""Marcello Lippi´s team departed with the battered pride of the country´s footballing reputation all but restored,"" declared the Shanghai Daily. ""For a nation with ambitions to be a major power within the game, there were positives to be gleaned."""

229,China's Xi slams unwillingness to combat climate change,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4852724/Chinas-Xi-slams-unwillingness-combat-climate-change.html," 04:42 BST, 5 September 2017 "," XIAMEN, China (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday warned that the world economy faces growing risks and uncertainties from countries turning inward on trade and resisting combating climate change, delivering an implicit rebuke to his American counterpart, Donald Trump. Xi didn't refer to the United States by name, although Trump has said trade pacts are a threat to American jobs and decided to pull the U.S. out of the Paris agreement on climate change. ""Multilateral trade negotiations are having a difficult time. The implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change is encountering resistance,"" Xi told leaders of emerging economies and developing countries.          Chinese President Xi Jinping listens to a speech during the Dialogue of Emerging Market and Developing Countries in Xiamen in southeastern China's Fujian Province, Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, Pool)  The agreement under which countries set their own national plans for cutting climate emissions went into effect in November. ""Some countries have become more inward-looking and less willing to take part in international cooperation, and the spillovers of their policy adjustments are deepening,"" he said during a summit of BRICS nations, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Xi's criticism came at the opening of a dialogue between the leaders of BRICS countries and five other developing nations invited to take part in the discussions on the sidelines of the summit in the southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen. On Monday's opening day of the summit, the BRICS countries called for reform of the United Nations and tougher measures against terrorist groups, while denouncing North Korea's latest nuclear test. The five also pledged their opposition to protectionism, a theme increasingly taken up by Xi despite what critics say are substantial barriers to foreign investment in key Chinese sectors such as electricity generation and telecommunications.

230,China distances children from families to subdue Muslim west,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6194959/China-distances-children-families-subdue-Muslim-west.html," 21:45 BST, 21 September 2018 "," ISTANBUL (AP) - The Chinese government has turned four of Meripet's children into orphans, even though she and her husband are alive. The kids were left with their grandmother when the couple visited Meripet's sick father in Turkey. But when Chinese authorities started locking up thousands of their fellow ethnic Uighurs for alleged subversive crimes such as travel abroad, a visit turned into exile. Then, her mother-in-law was jailed, and Meripet learned from a friend that her 3- to 8-year-olds were placed in a de facto orphanage in the Xinjiang region.          In this Aug. 20, 2018, photo, Meripet, 29, prays at her home in Istanbul, Turkey. Meripet came to Turkey in February 2017 to visit her sick father, leaving four children behind. While in Turkey, she heard Uighur passports were being seized and that people who had gone abroad were being taken to reeducation, so she stayed in Turkey, giving birth to Abduweli. She hasn't seen her other four children since, and heard they were taken to a live-in kindergarten in Hotan, China. (AP Photo/Dake Kang)  ""It's like my kids are in jail,"" Meripet said, her voice cracking. Meripet's family is among tens of thousands swept up in President Xi Jinping's campaign to subdue a sometimes restive region, including the internment of more than one million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. Now there is evidence that the government is placing the children of detainees and exiles into dozens of orphanages across Xinjiang. The orphanages are the latest example of how China is systematically distancing young Muslims in Xinjiang from their families and culture, The Associated Press has found through interviews with more than a dozen Muslims and a review of procurement documents. The government has been building thousands of so-called ""bilingual"" schools where minority children are penalized for using their native languages instead of Mandarin. Some of these are boarding schools, which Uighurs say can be mandatory and, in a Kazakh family's case, start from the age of five. China says the orphanages help disadvantaged children and denies the existence of internment camps for their parents. It prides itself on investing millions of yuan in education in Xinjiang to steer people out of poverty and away from terrorism. The country also maintains that strong measures are necessary to kill extremism in a region where it says Uighur separatists were responsible for the deaths of hundreds in past years. But Uighurs fear that these measures are wiping out their ethnic identity, one child at a time. ""If the kids are forced to speak Mandarin and live like Han Chinese every day, I'm afraid they won't be like us anymore,"" said Meriyem Yusup, whose extended family has four children sent to state-run orphanages in Xinjiang. Experts say what China is doing echoes how white colonialists in North America and Australia treated indigenous children. ""What we're looking at is something like a settler colonial situation where an entire generation is lost,"" said Darren Byler, a researcher of Uighur culture at University of Washington. Most of these families in China cannot be reached by journalists. However, the AP interviewed 14 Uighur families living in Turkey and one Kazakh man in Almaty with a total of 56 children who remain in China. The families say 14 appear to be in state-run orphanages and boarding schools, while the whereabouts of the rest are unknown because many of their adult relatives in Xinjiang have been detained. Some interviewees, like Meripet, requested that they be identified only by their first names because they feared official retaliation against their relatives. Since the start of last year, the government has budgeted more than $30 million (200 million Chinese yuan) to build or expand at least 45 orphanages, with enough beds to house about 5,000 children, an AP review of procurement notices in Xinjiang shows. In July and August alone, the government invited bids for the construction of at least nine such centers. These numbers do not include kindergartens and other schools where some children of Uighur detainees are also being housed. Shi Yuqing, a Kashgar civil affairs official, told the AP over the phone that ""authorities provide aid and support to everyone in need, whether they're the children of convicted criminals or people killed in traffic accidents."" The Xinjiang government did not respond to repeated requests for government. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said Thursday the measures taken in Xinjiang were necessary for ""stability, development, harmony."" Meripet's friend, who visited China last November, told her that her children are living in the Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten, where Meripet's sister-in-law was permitted to take them home for one night only. The schoolyard's entrance is blocked by an iron gate and adorned with the words ""We Are Happy and Grateful to the Motherland."" Armed police officers surrounded AP reporters minutes after their arrival and ordered them to delete any photos. Students at another kindergarten in Xinjiang were regularly asked by officials if their parents practiced religion at home, according to Dilnur, a 35-year-old business student in exile in Istanbul, whose children attended the school. A man was taken away by police after his grandson said in class that he had made a pilgrimage to Mecca, she recalled. Some bilingual schools are boarding schools, which are not uncommon in China. Adil Dalelkhan, an ethnic Kazakh sock merchant in exile in Almaty, said that even though his then five-year-old son could live with relatives, he was forced to stay at his preschool Mondays through Fridays instead. The father called the policy a ""terrifying"" step toward extinguishing Kazakh culture. An official Kashgar notice posted in February states that children in the fourth grade and above with parents in detention must be sent to boarding school immediately - even if one parent is still at home. In Istanbul, the only child still with Meripet is her fifth, a son born in Turkey whom she calls ""my only light."" ""I have only been able to keep living because I know there is hope,"" she said. ""I know one day I will see my children again."" ___ Associated Press writer Gillian Wong in Beijing contributed to this report. ___ Follow Yanan Wang and Dake Kang on Twitter at @yananw and @dakekang.

I remember turning again and again the pages of tiny photo book by Henri Cartier-Bresson, the famed French photographer and founder of Magnum Agency. The book, Les Danses à Bali ('Dances in Bali') was published soon after the photographer's visit to the island in 1949. With his exquisite art of catching expressions, Cartier-Bresson depicted the dancing schools of the island which enact some of the powerful scenes of the Ramayana, mostly portrayed by young tiny Balinese girls.          The Photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, pictured in 1981, captured the peaceful and spiritual atmosphere of Bali after visiting the islandMore than 65 years later, many things have changed on the island, but the peaceful spiritual atmosphere caught by the lens of Cartier-Bresson's Leica remains — with a difference, the hundreds of thousands of tourists. I could myself witness these changes during a recent visit to the 'paradise' island of Indonesia. The first 'incredible' experience is the arrival at Denpasar International Airport. Walking towards the immigration's counters, I could see hundreds of visitors of different nationalities — Westerners, Chinese, Malaysian, Japanese, and a few Indians — queuing for a visa.          Rice terraces in Bali. Just one of many features to attract more and more visitors to the islandI thought to myself, 'Oh no, it may take at least two hours before we get out of the airport.' We were in for a surprise — in less than 20 minutes, we were through. Being used to the Indian system (which has improved in recent years), I could not believe the speed with which the immigration officers were issuing visa-on arrival. They just scan your passport, which is then stamped and that is it. I recalled the cumbersome Inner Line Permit still in force in many states of India's Northeast.          Pura Ulun Danu Bratan, or Pura Bratan, is a major Shivaite and water temple on Bali, Indonesia. The temple complex is located on the shores of Lake Bratan in the mountains near Bedugul. Water temples serve the entire region in the outflow area.Why can't the Government of India introduce such a system in India when visitors want to enter Arunachal Pradesh or Nagaland? The babus of India are unfortunately unable to understand simplicity and efficiency; their system has to be complicated so that they are able to keep some 'control'. It is not that Bali has not faced security issues. On October 12, 2002, 202 people (including 88 Australians and 38 Indonesians) were killed in a suicide bomb attack.Another attack occurred three years later, killing four foreigners. But while 'security' is taken care of, the visitors are welcomed with a smile and a thunderous 'How are you, Sir/Ma'am'. India certainly has a lot to learn. A comparison with the northeast is interesting. Like the Balinese, its inhabitants are fun-loving and always smiling; they speak good English and are rather 'relaxed', furthermore, they are great hosts. The Seven (or Eight) Sisters could become the hub of domestic tourism if Delhi could understand the potential of tourism for the economy and the integration of the northeast.One evening, watching the Ramayana enacted by a large group of Balinese dancers and a choir 'in trance', I noticed how the island has become cosmopolitan while still being anchored deeply in its Hindu tradition. Was the way the main characters of the epic perform their roles now different from the one witnessed by Cartier-Bresson in 1949? Probably not. Sitting there, I was fascinated by the haunting chants of the choir, the battle between Good and Evil, with Sita prisoner of the evil Ravana and Hanuman jumping through and interacting with the crowd, to the amusement of all. Perhaps even more interesting, I happened to be surrounded by vociferous Muslim ladies from Malaysia, fully participating in the high drama on the stage. It was probably the magic of Hinduism to bring together such a motley crowd, vibrating in unison. Another interesting aspect linked with the island's present situation is the arrival of waves of Chinese visitors, linked with the much-talked about the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative of President Xi Jinping. Indonesia would like to participate in the ambitious dream by attracting 10 million tourists from China by 2019. The latest data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) show that 1.43 million Chinese tourists visited Bali in 2016, representing a 25 per cent annual increase over the previous year.           Sunset at Uluwatu temple in southern Bali. For Indonesia, tourism is a major source of revenueThe 10-million benchmark may be difficult to achieve for the Indonesian tourist industry. Moreover, a survey recently revealed that the typical Chinese tourist visiting Bali spends only one quarter of what is spent by their European and Australian counterpart. While for Indonesia, tourism is a source of hefty revenue, for China, it means a presence in South-East Asia. Agence France Press recently spoke of China's new weapon in the economic war, i.e. tourism, explaining: 'Slapping import bans on products like mangoes, coal and salmon has long been China's way of punishing countries that refuse to toe its political line. But Beijing has shown that it can also hurt others by cutting a lucrative Chinese export, tourism.' The article quotes the example of South Korea over a US anti-missile shield and the ban on Chinese tour groups from visiting Korea. Similarly, tourism to Taiwan has also fallen sharply as relations across the strait worsened. Countries submitting to China's demands are rewarded and those who do not 'behave' are punished. Closer to us, the Pakistani newspaper Dawn published earlier this month the 'hidden' report on CPEC. One of the chapters speaks about the development of a 'coastal tourism' industry; a long belt of coastal enjoyment industry that includes yacht wharfs, cruise homeports, nightlife, city parks, public squares, theatres, golf courses and spas, hot spring hotels and water sports. The report adds: 'for the development of coastal vacation products, Islamic culture, historical culture, folk culture and marine culture shall all be integrated.' Many see this as a new form of colonisation, though this is far from being the case in Bali as yet. The point remains that India has still a lot to learn from the island in terms of hospitality and cleanliness. "

The statement came after North Korea tested a missile that flew higher and longer than previous ones, sparking concerns around the world. Moscow and Beijing suggested that if Pyongyang halts nuclear and missile tests while the U.S. and Seoul freeze military maneuvers, the parties could sit down for talks that should lead to obligations not to use force and to refrain from aggression. ___ 12:45 p.m. Chinese President Xi Jinping is meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin for talks on boosting ties between the two allies. Xi's visit comes amid a flare-up of tensions in U.S.-China ties and an anxiety caused by North Korea's missile launch. The missile flew higher and farther than those previously tested. Welcoming Xi Tuesday, Putin said they would focus on economic and international issues. Before arriving in Moscow Monday, Xi warned President Donald Trump that ""some negative factors"" are hurting U.S.-China relations, as tensions soared over a U.S. destroyer sailing within the territorial seas limit of a Chinese-claimed island in the South China Sea. Trump, Putin and Xi will attend the Group of 20 summit in Germany later this week. Putin and Trump are to hold their first meeting there.

With the move, Italy becomes the first member of the Group of Seven major economies, which includes the United States, to join the Belt and Road program, following Portugal's embrace of the initiative in December. Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte and Chinese President Xi Jinping attended a ceremony in Rome where 29 separate protocols of the memorandum were signed by both governments in front of the flags of China, Italy and the European Union. Luigi di Maio, the Italian minister of economic development, told reporters afterward that his country's goal is to increase exports to China in order to correct trade imbalances and boost Italian businesses and the country's troubled economy. He said the value of the individual deals signed on Saturday amounts to 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion), with the potential to grow to 20 billion euros ($22.6 billion) ""Our goal with these accords is to start to rebalance an imbalance for which there is a lot of 'Made in China' coming to Italy and too little 'Made in Italy' that goes to China,"" Di Maio said. He said Italy now expects ""a substantial and gradual increase of exports and we hope that in the next years we can balance out the trade imbalances.""          Chinese President Xi Jinping, left, sits in front of the Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte ahead of the signing ceremony of a memorandum of understanding at Rome's Villa Madama, Saturday, March 23, 2019. Italy signed a memorandum of understanding with China on Saturday in support of Beijing's ""Belt and Road"" initiative, which aims to weave a network of ports, bridges and power plants linking China with Africa, Europe and beyond. (Giuseppe Lami/ANSA Via AP)  Italy's move appears to also be driven by hopes that Chinese investment in Italy's ports might help revive the country's traditional role as a key link in trade between the East and West. The signed accords are wide-ranging and include cooperation between banks, between a Chinese construction company and Italian ports, and the export of Italian fruit to China. The deals also foresee cooperation in the spheres of science and technology and between media outlets, as well as the return by Italy of hundreds of Chinese cultural treasures. The signing ceremony took place at the Villa Madama, a Renaissance villa designed by Raphael, where Xi was greeted with full honors on the second day of his two-day visit to Italy. He then traveled to Sicily, where officials hope to attract more Chinese tourism. Italy's involvement in the Belt and Road program gives China a crucial inroad into Western Europe and a symbolic boost in its economic tug-of-war with Washington, where President Donald Trump is challenging China over trade and other issues. The EU, however, is worried about unfair competition from Chinese companies, which are controlled by the Chinese government and benefit from the state's financial backing. EU leaders in Brussels are preparing a strategy to counter the growing influence of China, which they describe as a ""systemic rival."" Some Italian government officials were critical of the deals, worried that Italy might be ceding national sovereignty in key strategic areas to Beijing. In a sign of opposition, Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and interior minister, stayed away from the official ceremonies with the Chinese delegation. Di Maio stressed that Italy remains firmly rooted in its alliance with the United States, NATO and its European partners, but said Italy must also look out for its own economic interests. ""Like someone in the United States said 'America first,' I continue to repeat: 'Italy first' in commercial relations,"" Di Maio said. In response to concerns that the memorandum could open the way to colonization by China, Di Maio countered it would instead help goods manufactured in Italy ""to colonize the world."" ""That is a good colonialization,"" he said. The Belt and Road project has so far seen investments totaling more than a trillion dollars since its launch more than five years ago, and China says some 150 countries have signed agreements related to the project. Beijing has marketed the initiative as a way to give some of the world's neediest countries a leg up, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. But it also helps Chinese companies tap new markets for their products while helping Beijing amass greater global influence. Some governments including the U.S., Japan and India worry that Beijing is trying to build a China-centered sphere of influence that undermines their own sway, pulling developing nations into infrastructure ""debt traps"" that would give China ever-more control over their territories and economies. Some say the proposed improvements are too expensive for the impoverished countries. China's official position is that Belt and Road is solely an economic initiative with no political motives. Xi said last year that even as China moves closer to the center of the world stage, it will never seek hegemony.

239,Why China's aluminium industry is praying for blue skies: Andy Home,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-5012529/Why-Chinas-aluminium-industry-praying-blue-skies-Andy-Home.html," 14:20 BST, 24 October 2017 "," By Andy Home LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Winter is coming in China and that means large swaths of industrial capacity in the regions around Beijing and Tianjin must cut production. Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised ""blue skies"" will replace the choking smog that envelops many cities in the country's industrial heartlands, particularly over the ""winter heating"" months. Heavily polluting industries in the targeted regions will therefore have to reduce output between November and March. If that means massive disruption to supply chains, so be it. Aluminium production will be cut by 30 percent. Ironically, the ""green"" metal, used in ever greater quantities by automotive makers looking to reduce vehicle weight, is made using coal power in this part of China. And coal is enemy number one in Beijing's eyes. How much production will be cut is of crucial significance to the aluminium market since China is the world's largest producer and a huge exporter of semi-manufactured aluminium products. The lack of a ready answer to that question is keeping the London aluminium price expectantly poised just below September's five-year high of $2,199 per tonne. The winter curtailments also apply to key inputs in the smelting process such as alumina and carbon anode. The alumina price has recently surged, although there is no answer to how this part of the sector will be impacted. It is a complex pricing conundrum, transmitting instability into the global marketplace. It is also a massive experiment. Beijing has wrenched all the levers of a centrally planned economy to wage war on smog. Soon we'll see how successful it is. Graphic on China's aluminium production: http://tmsnrt.rs/2l9Spmp LOST IN THE COUNT Aluminium's focus on what exactly is happening in China has shone a harsh light on the official figures released monthly by the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association (CNIA) via the International Aluminium Institute. A history of outsized revisions and unusual monthly swings was previously a headache only for the market's statistical boffins. But now it's everybody's headache. As a timely reminder of the fragility of this apparently ""hard"" data set, CNIA has just added a million tonnes of production into its calculations. Backdated to the start of last year, this previously missing capacity is now included in the ""unreported"" column. It's only a small part of the statistical jigsaw, however. Some analysts argue the CNIA undercount of actual production is much larger with as much as 6 million tonnes annualised, a tenth of global output, now ""missing"". Problems with the count date to July, when national production, at least according to the official figures, plunged by 4.1 million tonnes annualised. This was broadly in line with the announced closures of ""illegal capacity"", those smelters operating without the full gamut of licences. But smelters can't power down that fast, suggesting they simply dropped out of the spreadsheet rather than out of production. For what it's worth, the official figures show national output running relatively smoothly over the last two months with a marginal net increase of 21,000 tonnes. That should change over the winter months, with up to 1 million tonnes of production at potential risk. The size of the hit should become more precise as individual cities release their targets. Liaocheng, for example, has just published its order that Xinfa Group, one of China's top producers, switch off 30 percent of the pots at its smelter in the city, representing around 382,000 tonnes of capacity. But a clearer statistical future isn't much use if the recent statistical past is so murky. Nor is it likely to get any clearer. This war of numbers is probably going to last as long as Beijing's war on smog. MITIGATING THE HIT? How China's aluminium supply chain adapts to these closures is highly uncertain. There is some cushion against disruption. It's worth remembering that, even allowing for a potential undercount, the country's production is officially still up 5 percent this year. Rusal and Alcoa have just released third-quarter results and assess the Chinese market as being in surplus this year to the tune of 1 to 2 million tonnes. (Both, by the way, also have offsetting deficits in the rest of the world.) In China itself, visible aluminium stocks have been growing. Inventory registered with the Shanghai Futures Exchange is at a record high of 615,370 tonnes. All of which suggests Chinese producers have been maximising production to compensate for the coming collective power-down. ALUMINA PRICE ROCKETS There may, however, be some powerful knock-on shocks from curtailments in aluminium's raw materials supply chain. Factbox on alumina curtailments: Alumina refineries are also taking their 30-percent cuts. In the case of Chalco's Zhongzhou unit in Jiaozuo city in Henan, it had to close as early as September. If alumina closures exactly match aluminium closures, the two markets should rebalance smoothly. That, however, seems unlikely at this stage. The market seems to be betting on disruption. The CME alumina contract, indexed against Platts' assessment of the spot market, has jumped from $315 per tonne at the start of September to a current $464.67. It's also worth noting that China's alumina imports have recently picked up after slumping in the first half of the year. Down 17 percent in the first six months, the cumulative total through September is now up 3 percent. The country may need to import a lot more still, but how much is unknowable, given the lack of visibility on the scale of curtailments. SAME TIME NEXT YEAR? Chinese winter is going to instil unprecedented uncertainty into a global aluminium supply chain that has grown accustomed to worrying about too much rather than too little production. Quantifying the likely outcome of the winter curtailments is tricky work in progress, leaving prices beholden to the latest city to add its part to the production jigsaw. But even more unsettling is the fact that this is all going to happen again next year. And the year after that. President Xi, speaking at last week's opening of the Communist Party congress, promised a years-long battle to achieve his ""blue skies"" dream. With a promise like that, China's aluminium sector, like many others, can only hope that this year's winter curtailments do the trick. Because if they don't, next year's winter heating season could be even more disruptive. Beijing will be keeping a hawk-like eye on its urban pollution gauges over the next few months.

241,"Mao or never: In Xi's China, a village clings to past",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4976440/Mao-never-In-Xis-China-village-clings-past.html," 07:12 BST, 13 October 2017 ","          Every year, hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to the hamlet in central Henan province which has become an attraction with its idealised vision of village life right out of the Communist past  Disneyland has ""Main Street, USA"", a monorail and Mickey Mouse. China's Nanjie village has ""East is Red Square"", red trams and Mao Zedong. Every year, hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to the hamlet in central Henan province which has become an attraction with its idealised vision of village life right out of the Communist past. While the Communist Party prepares to give a second term to its current supremo, Xi Jinping, at a major congress next week, Nanjie still clings firmly to Mao, while glossing over the turbulence and violence of his rule. The village's 3,700 residents wake up every morning to broadcasts praising Mao and start their work days with a hearty group rendition of ""red"" songs about the virtues of Communism.          Nanjie follows a retro model of collectively-owned enterprises and chirpy ideological indoctrination, appearing frozen in an era before market reforms transformed China into the world's second largest economy  Nanjie follows a retro model of collectively-owned enterprises and chirpy ideological indoctrination, appearing frozen in an era before market reforms transformed China into the world's second largest economy. Tourists take small red trams with names like ""Moderate Prosperity"" and ""Chinese Dream"" from the giant Mao statue in the town's iconic ""East is Red Square"" to parks, factories and public housing blocks where residents share stories about the joys of collectivism. But its brand of Communism looks set to make a comeback, attracting more than just tourists these days, with Xi recently telling top officials that the party ""would lose its soul and direction"" if it deviated from Marxism. Even ""Xi is asking everyone to study Chairman Mao,"" said Wang Hongbin, who has been Nanjie's party secretary since 1976 and will attend next week's congress in Beijing. Since taking power in 2012, Xi has pushed for more state control over the economy while Communist Party branches are being set up inside private enterprises for employees to study party ideology.          Factory managers sing communist ""red"" songs at the start of their work day in Nanjie village  He has also dramatically increased ideological indoctrination in schools and the workplace and tightened media controls. Recently, nostalgia seekers have been replaced by local officials and party members ""coming to study the Nanjie spirit,"" local journalist Lie Xiujuan said as she led visitors on a tour of the village's botanical gardens, which feature a life-size replica of Mao's childhood home. - 'Closer and closer' - In the 1980s, when most of China was sprinting away from Mao-era collectivism, Nanjie's party secretary Wang doubled down. He turned up the ideological volume and offered free housing, health care and food to residents working for a pittance at village-owned enterprises. The moves found favour with the country's leftists, but many people ""didn't understand Nanjie, didn't support it or even criticised it,"" Wang recently told state media.          In the 1980s, when most of China was sprinting away from Mao-era collectivism, Nanjie's party secretary Wang turned up the ideological volume  Since the last party congress in 2012, however, ""the central government's voice has grown closer and closer to Nanjie's way of doing things."" Today, residents live in modest public apartments, identical right down to the furniture and flatscreen TVs. ""Everything is managed very well,"" government employee Wang Chunju said as she sat in her community-provided flat, fidgeting with her iPhone. - 'Real communists' - But it is hard to tell how much is real and how much is a show for Nanjie's more than 500,000 visitors a year. A weekly newspaper publishes ""positive"" news alongside Mao quotes and stories.          Shoppers at Nanjie's largest store can use a government-issued card to buy cabbage and onions, but they can also purchase gold jewelry or a carved wooden Mao  At Nanjie's instant noodle factory, local officials freely admitted to staging ""every day"" performances of Communist ""red"" songs for the benefit of visiting reporters. Nanjie's economics are also more complicated than advertised. The village may be a Communist collective, but much like China's overall economy, its development is unequal and massively leveraged. Shoppers at the village's largest store can use a government-issued card to buy cabbage and onions, but they can also purchase gold jewelry or a carved wooden Mao, retailing for 16,900 yuan ($2,570). Over 90 percent of the workers at Nanjie's 26 cooperatives are recruited from outside the village and do not enjoy its benefits. In 2008, an investigation by Southern Metropolis Daily revealed the village had taken out more than 1.6 billion yuan of bank loans due to what Wang described as ""economic problems"".          While officials say tourism makes only a small contribution to Nanjie's economy, its image is an asset that earns it the support of top politicians, as well as the general public  China's ""leaders"" ordered Henan to solve the issue, he told AFP, and the debts were effectively forgiven. Now the village ""relies on the strength of its own enterprises to develop"", he said, adding that profits have grown by 24 percent year-on-year. Although Wang and other government officials receive a monthly salary of only 250 yuan ($38), he previously owned almost 10 percent of the collectives' holding company, according to the Southern Metropolis Daily report. In 2014, the corporation underwent a change in shareholders, but the records have been sealed. While officials said tourism makes only a small contribution to Nanjie's economy, its image is an asset that earns it the support of top politicians, as well as the general public. Outside Nanjie's gates, a woman working at a liquor store admiringly explained the village's fascination. ""They're real Communists over there,"" she said with a laugh. ""I guess you could say the rest of us are capitalists."""

(AP Photo/Eranga Jayawardena) ""The world sees India as the new frontier of economic opportunity. But, our neighbors should have the first claim on India,"" he said.""I will be happy if India serves as a catalyst in the progress of our neighbors.""Modi said India has committed $1.6 billion in development assistance for Sri Lanka.""Today, we have committed further assistance of up to $318 million to the railway sector,"" he said, promising to continue the development partnership. ""And, we will do so with the same level of transparency that we expect in our own country,"" he added.Modi visited Seychelles and Mauritius before Sri Lanka on his tour of Indian Ocean states. China in recent years heavily funded infrastructure development projects in these countries, making India apprehensive because it perceives the region to be its traditional territory of influence.He avoided visiting the Maldives, which has a pro-China administration and where a pro-India opposition leader is being tried for terrorism.Modi became the first Indian leader to visit Sri Lanka in 28 years, reciprocating the trip to India last month by Sri Lanka's new president.Although divided by a strait just 50 kilometers (30 miles) wide, Sri Lanka and India kept distance over the past three decades. Their relations have been marred by the failed Indian peacekeeping attempt at the onset of Sri Lanka's civil war and more recently, Beijing's foray into India's neighborhood.However Modi since his election last May has emphasized rally his neighbors.Modi held bilateral talks with Sri Lanka's new President Maithripala Sirisena, who made a departure from policies favoring Beijing and toward ethnic reconciliation with his country's Tamil minority, a sensitive issue in India-Sri Lanka relations.""We have seen the relationship between our countries weakened during the time of some regimes. As a result, it took 28 years for this visit of an Indian prime minister to Sri Lanka,"" Sirisena said after the morning meeting with Modi.He said he considered Modi's visit now was a blessing.Modi in his speech to Parliament also invited Sri Lanka to have more regular state visits and work together to build trust and remain sensitive to each other's interest.""I am conscious of the significance of this visit,"" Modi said in a statement following talks with Sirisena. ""This is how it should be between neighbors. We should meet regularly. It helps us understand each other better find solutions to mutual concerns and move our relationship forward.""In 1987, India's Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi arrived in Sri Lanka to sign a peace accord in an effort to end the Tamil uprising, which was then in its early years. Sri Lankan Tamils have linguistic and family connections with the sizable Tamil population in India.It was a tumultuous period in relations as India was accused of training and arming the rebels, and then tried to mediate by sending a peacekeeping force, a mission that failed as the Indians were viewed with suspicion by both sides in the civil war.During his visit, Gandhi narrowly escaped serious injury when a Sri Lankan sailor hit him with his rifle butt during a guard of honor inspection. Four years later, in 1991, the Tamil Tigers assassinated Gandhi during an election rally in southern India.Since then, India had distanced itself from the Sri Lankan conflict, which China used to get closer to the island nation by supplying weapons and later securing a large presence through developing highways, a port and an airport.Sri Lanka's new government has recently suspended the Chinese-funded $1.5 billion Colombo Port City project, citing environmental issues and alleged corruption. It was inaugurated in September during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who included Sri Lanka in a new maritime ""Silk Road"" linking the energy-rich Persian Gulf with China.Modi will visit the war-scarred Tamil heartland in the north on Saturday to inaugurate a railway line rebuilt by India.

243,Don't treat us as heroes says bailed Hong Kong activist Wong,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5031287/Dont-treat-heroes-says-bailed-Hong-Kong-activist-Wong.html," 11:13 BST, 30 October 2017 ","          Wong, 21, was released last week on bail, with fellow activist Nathan Law, pending an appeal against their jail terms  Ten weeks in jail has had an effect on Joshua Wong; he is pensive, reflective and thinner. It is an experience that has forced him to weigh up the cost of being the most recognised face of Hong Kong's democracy campaign. His imprisonment alongside two other leading activists for their role in the massive 2014 Umbrella Movement rallies, which called for fully free leadership elections, came after the city's Beijing-backed government pursued jail terms for the trio. That was widely seen as another illustration of the pressure semi-autonomous Hong Kong is under from an increasingly assertive China, and brought into question whether its cherished independent judiciary has been compromised. Wong, 21, and fellow activist Nathan Law, 24, were released last week on bail pending an appeal against their jail terms. If they lose, they could be sent back to serve the remainder of their sentences -- Wong was given six months, Law eight months. Prison demands ""absolute submission"" to the authorities there, Wong says, describing his anger at how marginalised young people he met in jail were treated. He was housed in a cell measuring around 50 square feet (4.5 sq m), and recalls how he was forced to crouch naked in front of one officer who said he wanted to see whether he could use a squat toilet. ""We'd just had our body checks, which were not a problem, but after that he didn't let me put back on my clothes, and made me squat, tilt my head up and talk to him. Prison is not a place to have dignity,"" Wong told AFP. In addition to the current jail term, Wong is also awaiting sentencing on another charge relating to the 2014 protests, which brought parts of Hong Kong to a standstill for more than two months in an unprecedented rebuke to Beijing. But as supporters around the world expressed their outrage at the jailings, Wong said they should not lionise the activists. ""I hope as people continue to show their support, they won't treat us too much like heroes,"" said Wong. He has become particularly conscious of the toll on his family. Wong still lives with his parents and shares a bedroom with his brother, which is filled with books and the young activist's robot collection. ""Outside of our role as political leaders, we are also someone's child, or someone's boyfriend or girlfriend. When we go to jail, the people around us suffer more."" - Growing danger - Despite the pressures, there is no sign that Wong intends giving up his dream of full democracy for Hong Kong. He was encouraged when tens of thousands took to the streets to protest the activists' imprisonment. ""As Hong Kong faces a situation where there are increasing numbers of political prisoners, I've seen more Hong Kong people who are willing to come out,"" says Wong. ""This gives me more determination to fight for democracy and on this path, we actually don't feel lonely.""          The 2014 protests, which brought parts of Hong Kong to a standstill for more than two months, were seen as an unprecedented rebuke to Beijing  But he acknowledges that continuing the fight is likely to become increasingly difficult as Chinese leader Xi Jinping emphasises zero tolerance of any challenges to Beijing's sovereignty. The party Wong set up with Law, Demosisto, advocates self-determination and is pushing for Hong Kong people to be able to choose their own fate ahead of 2047, when the handover agreement expires and the city returns fully to Chinese rule. ""(Beijing's) policies for Hong Kong will be more severe in restricting our disappearing freedoms,"" predicts Wong. Hong Kong has been governed under a ""one country, two systems"" deal since it was handed back by Britain to China in 1997, allowing it rights unseen on the mainland, including freedom of speech and a partially directly elected parliament. The Umbrella Movement called for universal suffrage to replace a system where the city's leader is selected by a pro-Beijing committee, but failed to win concessions. Since then there have been growing signs that China is tightening its grip, with Beijing particularly incensed by demands from some activists for independence for Hong Kong. A number of leading campaigners have been charged in relation to the 2014 protests. Six pro-democracy legislators -- including two pro-independence activists -- have been disqualified from parliament. Mainland Chinese officials have called on Hong Kong to introduce patriotic education, a version of which was shelved in 2012 after mass protests led by Wong, then just 15-years-old. Wong believes ""ideological control"" from Beijing will weigh on Hong Kong, but will eventually trigger a backlash from the younger generation.

The property market that has fuelled much of China's growth has hit the doldrums in the past two years, with new buyers priced out despite government borrowing restrictions reining in soaring costs ©Johannes Eisele (AFP/File) But while they are free to move in search of employment, they and their children have long been denied equal access to public services such as schools, hospitals and housing under a decades-old household registration system known as ""hukou"".As a result they have been denied a full share of the prosperity they have created, while a generation of their children have been ""left behind"" to be raised by their grandparents or other family members -- or some simply left on their own.At the same time the property market that has fuelled much of China's growth has hit the doldrums in the last two years, with new buyers priced out despite government borrowing restrictions reining in soaring costs.Now authorities are trying to address both issues simultaneously, reforming the hukou system to encourage migrants to buy properties in the towns and cities where they work.Only 10 percent of migrants have bought a home in the places they have moved to, according to the World Bank.But analysts say there are multiple obstacles to the concept, not least affordability.""Without a lot of supporting policies, the initial impact will be relatively limited,"" Brian Jackson, a Beijing-based analyst with research firm IHS Economics, told AFP.Liu, from Lankao in Henan -- a central province that is one of China's poorest -- abandoned his life as a farmer and now earns up to 6,000 yuan ($900) a month in Beijing.New home prices in the capital averaged 34,925 yuan per square metre in November, according to a survey by the China Index Academy (CIA), which is linked to the country's biggest property website.Liu dreams of owning a home in the capital, but would have to save for decades before that could come true.""I would love to stay in the city,"" he said. ""But I don't have the money and so I don't have any buying plans.""- Land rights -The hukou reform plans, unveiled last week after a key four-day economic planning meeting addressed by President Xi Jinping, would make more migrants eligible for urban registrations more quickly.The thinking is that incomers would be more likely to invest in a permanent home if they could enjoy the same rights as official residents.""We must implement household registration reform plans... to cultivate (migrants') expectations and demand for the purchase or long-term lease of a house in their place of work,"" said a statement released by the official Xinhua news agency following the meeting.It was the first time authorities have explicitly and publicly linked hukou reform -- which has been repeatedly promised over the years -- to property sales.But while holders of urban hukous have access to services, rural hukous give their holders rights to use land, which in China is all owned by the state. Many expect those rights to become tradeable assets if and when China ever reforms its land laws, making them reluctant to give them up.""Not all rural residents are willing to become urban dwellers,"" said Wendy Chen, an analyst with Nomura International in Shanghai. ""One of their concerns is... whether they can retain their land.""Across 100 major Chinese cities, November's average new home price was 10,899 yuan per square metre, according to CIA, but employment opportunities -- and wages -- decline with city size.In lower-tier cities ""there might not be a strong labour incentive to move there"", said Jackson of IHS Economics.- Ghost towns -Urbanisation and property development have been key drivers of China's decades of growth as they fuel demand for many other industries including steel and cement.A 10 percent increase in residential property investment yields a full percentage point of additional GDP growth, according to Niny Khor, an economist with the Asian Development Bank in Beijing.China's long property boom, driven by credit and government spending, made fortunes for many owners as new districts mushroomed across the country.But several have since become ""ghost towns"", and many Chinese cities have a glut of empty and unsold residential property.At the same time developers who took big bets on continuing housing growth still have huge loans to repay.China's home sales fell 7.8 percent by value in 2014, as the country's GDP growth slowed to 7.3 percent, its weakest since 1990.

The National People's Congress also appointed close Xi ally Wang Qishan to the formerly ceremonial post of vice president. At the Great Hall of the People, Xi, Wang and other officials took turns stepping to the lectern to place their left hands on the constitution and raise their right fists as they delivered an oath swearing loyalty to the constitution, the motherland and the people.

Xi was reappointed Saturday as China's president with no limit on the number of terms he can serve. The ceremonial National People's Congress voted unanimously for Xi's second five-year term as president. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)  All 2,970 members of the National People's Congress in attendance approved Xi's reappointment, while Wang received just one vote against. Xi, who leads the ruling 90 million-member Communist Party, was also reappointed as head of the government commission that commands the military. He is already head of an identical party body overseeing the 2 million-member force. Xi, 64, is considered the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. Last weekend, he was given the right to continue in office indefinitely after the legislature scrapped term limits for the president and vice president. Chinese officials defended the move, saying it would bring the presidency in line with Xi's other two main positons of head of the party and commander of the armed forces. Critics say the move, which overturns a push to institutionalize China's ruling practices dating from 1982, will likely lead to increased political repression and possible infighting among party factions seeking to promote their own candidates within the closed system. Xi took office as president in 2013 and hasn't said how many additional five-year terms he intends to serve. State media has said the removal of term limits will not alter conditions for retirement or create a president in perpetuity, but has offered no details. Xi is expected to expand his yearslong campaign against corruption within the Communist Party to include all state employees through the creation of a new National Supervisory Commission, while continuing to pursue a muscular foreign policy and policies to upgrade the slowing economy. Economic growth and social stability have allowed Xi to amend the constitution and carry out other moves that once seemed highly contentious, said Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese Studies and director of the Lau China Institute at King's College, London. ""Really no one is going to shout and moan too much"" because growth and stability are considered so important, Brown said Friday in a talk to foreign media in Beijing. As China's vice president, the 69-year-old Wang is expected to be a key element in furthering Xi's agenda of shoring up Communist Party rule while ending corruption and poverty.

The slide toward one-man rule under Xi has fueled concern that Beijing is eroding efforts to guard against the excesses of autocratic leadership and make economic regulation more stable and predictable.

In a 20-minute segment aired on HBO last Sunday, Oliver criticised China's moves to end presidential term limits and enshrine ""Xi Jinping Thought"" in its constitution, saying Xi's consolidation of power was driven by a ""leadership cult"". Oliver also mocked China's ""Belt and Road"" initiative, its ongoing crackdown on corruption, and moves to censor online images of the cartoon bear Winnie the Pooh, said to resemble Xi. Attempts to post Oliver's English name or the name of his show prompted error messages about ""information that violated related laws and regulations"". The Chinese translation of his name does not appear to have been censored. ""For my whole life, I won't be able to see John Oliver enter China's market after this episode,"" one Weibo user wrote on Thursday, using a Chinese translation of Oliver's name. On Thursday, June 12 was the most recent date on Weibo posts referring to John Oliver in English. Last year, Weibo removed a Chinese-language fanpage of John Oliver's show after the satirist interviewed Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, according to a previous moderator of the fanpage. The fanpage had a following of around 3,000 users at the time, said the moderator, who declined to be identified. ""John Oliver must have seen this coming, but I don't think it really matters. China does not generate any revenue for HBO,"" said a fan who used to help translate content for the show into Chinese. He, too, sought anonymity.

Xi made the assurances after holding talks with President Rodrigo Duterte and other officials on a visit to the Philippines aimed at deepening relations with the American treaty ally. Xi's overnight visit to the Philippine capital, Manila, was his last stop on a three-nation swing through Asia, where he has offered infrastructure loans and aid and championed free trade amid a rivalry for regional influence with the United States. ""We will continue to manage contentious issues and promote maritime cooperation through friendly consultation,"" Xi said. He said China aims to conclude the talks on the ""code of conduct"" in the disputed waters with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations within three years. Four members of the 10-nation bloc - Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam - along with China and Taiwan have overlapping claims in the South China Sea. Many fear the long-simmering disputes could spark an armed conflict that could shatter Asia's bustling economies. Ahead of Xi's visit, China and the Philippines tried to negotiate an agreement allowing joint oil and gas exploration in the disputed waters, but apparently did not reach a consensus. They signed a ""memorandum of understanding on cooperation on oil and gas development"" on Tuesday but officials provided few details.

Xi visited the Philippines for the first time to deepen ties with America's ally. (AP Photo/Bullit Marquez)  ""It's a cooperation to find ways to find a solution,"" Philippine Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said of the agreement. China has sought a ""maritime and air liaison mechanism,"" an arrangement for forces of the two countries to coordinate their naval and aircraft movements to prevent incidents in the contested waters, but the proposal has been opposed by Philippine defense officials, two Philippine officials told The Associated Press. There was no mention of the pact after Tuesday's meetings. Filipino nationalists have warned that any agreement that can undermine the Philippines' internationally recognized exclusive rights to fish and exploit resources within 200 nautical miles of the country's coast would violate the Philippine Constitution. Beijing's relations with Manila deteriorated over the territorial rifts until Duterte won the presidency in mid-2016 and sought to rebuild ties with China while criticizing U.S. security policies in a dramatic pivot. The administration of Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, had brought the territorial disputes with China to international arbitration and won, but China has ignored the outcome. Duterte has refused to immediately demand Chinese compliance with the ruling, which invalidated China's sweeping claims to the waters, where Beijing has transformed a string of disputed reefs into missile-protected island bases. Duterte's rapprochement has fostered a new era of warmer relations with the Asian economic powerhouse, from which he has sought trade and investment, infrastructure financing and weapons to fight insurgents. While Western governments have sharply criticized Duterte's brutal crackdown on illegal drugs, China has not. Both Xi and Duterte have often been in the crosshairs of human rights groups. Xi said he and Duterte ""agreed to elevate our relationship into one of comprehensive, strategic cooperation,"" adding, ""it sends a strong message to the world that our two countries are partners in seeking common development."" Xi's visit to the Philippines is the first by a Chinese president in 13 years. More than 300 protesters with placards reading ""Hands off our land and seas"" rallied in front of the Chinese Consulate in Manila. Another group of protesters later burned mock Chinese flags near the presidential palace, where Xi and Duterte met. Duterte said Philippine participation in Beijing's ""Belt and Road Initiative"" was discussed and Xi invited the Philippine leader to attend the infrastructure loan program's second international forum in China next year. The ambitious program has been criticized by the United States as enticing poor nations into debt bondage and has warned it could compromise their independence. Xi has denied that Chinese loans could lead to a ""debt trap."" Aside from their trade disputes, China and the United States have wrestled over Beijing's assertive claims to the South China Sea. Chinese officials have asked Washington to back off from what they say is a purely Asian dispute, but the U.S. has vowed to maintain a presence in the waters, where it has no claims but has pledged to promote freedom of navigation and overflight. ""We will continue to fly and sail wherever international law allows and our national interests demand; harassment will only strengthen our resolve. We will not change course,"" U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said at a meeting last week in Papua New Guinea that was attended by leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, including Xi.

Xi visited the tiny Mediterranean principality Sunday as part of a European tour that is clouded by mixed feelings about how to engage with China and benefit from its trade - while setting limits on its appetite for greater economic and diplomatic influence. Xi's appearance alongside Monaco's Prince Albert and Princess Charlene marked the first state visit by a Chinese president to the principality. The palace said Monaco is interested in increased trade and economic cooperation with China and ""boosting China's image in the principality."" Monaco last year clinched a deal with Chinese tech company Huawei to develop its 5G telecommunications network - a thorny issue for several European countries. The U.S. government says Huawei's 5G network could give Chinese security services a backdoor to spy on consumers, and has pressed European partners to shun it. Huawei says the fear is unfounded. Monaco imposed exceptional security for the Chinese visitors: The entire ""Rocher"" - the nickname for the cliff that Monaco is perched on - was effectively shut down for the day.

(AP Photo/Olivier Anrigo)  ""It's the first time I've seen this ... stores closed, windows shuttered, no one in the street,"" said Marc Bonafede, owner of Le Castelroc restaurant in front of the palace. He said he hadn't seen such heavy security even when Albert buried his father, Prince Rainier, or held his royal wedding to Charlene. Monaco banned all flights in its airspace during Xi's brief visit and any sailing in its waters or mooring in its luxury yacht-filled harbor. The nearby French city of Nice, where Xi is spending the night, was similarly cordoned off. The Promenade des Anglais - the palm-lined beachside avenue that is the city's premier attraction - was closed to traffic all weekend. The promenade was targeted by a deadly extremist attack in 2016. Outside the French resort town of Beaulieu-sur-Mer, where Xi was dining Sunday night with French President Emmanuel Macron, a police boat patrolled throughout the day, and police divers worked to secure the area. Xi will sign energy and other contracts with Macron on Monday, then meet in Paris on Tuesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. The European Union is China's biggest trading partner, but many in Europe worry about unfair competition from Chinese companies that benefit from government financial backing. Xi comes to Monaco and France from Italy, which just endorsed a vast Chinese transport infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative. Macron criticized Italy's move, calling for a concerted European approach to China instead. ""There is this bad European habit to have 28 different policies, with countries competing against each other to attract investment,"" a top French official said. ""We need to speak with a common voice if we want to exist. We have the same approach on the 5G issue: avoiding 28 different decisions."" France hasn't decided yet whether to let Huawei build its 5G networks but it's likely to be a subject of discussions during the Chinese leader's visit. Europe wants to increase trade with China but on European terms, especially amid U.S.-China trade tensions. France also wants China's cooperation on climate diplomacy, in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's skepticism. Human rights concerns in China seem a lesser concern now than when Chinese leaders visited Europe in the past, though Macron's office says the French leader will raise concerns about China's repression of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang. The U.S. State Department says China has ""significantly intensified"" a campaign of mass detentions of minority Uighurs over the last year, with between 800,000 and 2 million people interned in camps that have drawn condemnation from across the world. ___ Charlton reported from Paris.

As Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar said after the June 9 meeting, 'There was an understanding that where we have differences, it is important that differences should not become dispute.'Yet China undertook its manoeuver in Doklam barely hours before. This is not the first time that the PLA's actions have contradicted the seemingly reassuring words of its leader Xi, who heads the powerful Central Military Commission.In September 2014, as Modi hosted Xi in Gujarat and the two leaders were photographed on a jhula and doing a diplomatic tango, the PLA violated the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Chumar and Demchok in Ladakh in the western sector.

279,Trump kicks off Florida meetings with Chinese president,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4387806/Chinese-leader-arrives-face-face-Trump.html," 19:20 BST, 6 April 2017 ","PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping opened their high-stakes summit at Trump's Florida beach resort Thursday, with the urgent threat of North Korea's nuclear ambitions and tensions over trade on the agenda.Xi's visit was overshadowed, though, by a U.S. missile barrage on an air base in Syria in response to this week's chemical weapons attack against civilians, which the U.S. blamed on President Bashar Assad. The U.S. announced the missile attack shortly after Xi and his wife left the Mar-a-Lago estate Thursday night.Trump appeared lighthearted earlier Thursday as he greeted Xi at Mar-A-Lago, gesturing and pointing to journalists as they tussled to get a shot of the two leaders together for the first time.       President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands during a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Thursday, April 6, 2017, in Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)Ahead of the dinner, Trump said he and Xi already had had a long discussion and had ""developed a friendship,"" and then joked, ""I have gotten nothing, absolutely nothing.""The White House said the location was selected to give the two days of discussions a more relaxed feel. A number of Trump's top advisers were in attendance, including his daughter, Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Outside the dining room where the two delegations gathered for a lavish dinner, Mar-a-Lago club members packed the patio for dinner.Trump and first lady Melania Trump greeted Xi and his wife at Mar-a-Lago before making their way to dinner.On Air Force One on the way to Florida Trump pointed to the crisis in North Korea as a top priority in the meetings with Xi. He said he thinks China will ""want to be stepping up"" in trying to deter North Korea's nuclear ambitions.While Trump would not say what he wants China to do specifically, he suggested there was a link between ""terrible"" trade agreements the U.S. has made with China and Pyongyang's provocations. He says the two issues ""really do mix.""The president has said that if China doesn't exert more pressure on North Korea, the U.S. will act alone.Both as a candidate and president, Trump has taken an aggressive posture toward China, labeling Beijing a ""tremendous problem"" and arguing that lopsided trade deals with China shortchange American businesses and workers. Last week, the president predicted in a tweet that his meeting with Xi would be ""very difficult.""The White House has downplayed expectations for a breakthrough on issues like trade and tariffs, insisting that the 24-hour summit is mostly an introductory meeting for the two leaders. And within Trump's administration, there are still divisions over how to approach China.According to U.S. and foreign officials, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and economic adviser Gary Cohn are leading the charge for boosting ties and exploring the potential for greater economic cooperation. But economic adviser Peter Navarro, author of the book ""Death by China: Confronting the Dragon - a Global Call to Action,"" prefers trying to isolate China, in keeping with Trump's ""America First"" mantra.Patrick Cronin, a China expert with the Center for a New American Security, said the Trump administration does not have ""a reconciled trade and economic policy yet, and the differing views on China in the White House underscore that.""Ahead of the summit, Trump signed a pair of executive orders focused on reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The moves appeared to be a shot at China, which accounted for the vast bulk - $347 billion - of last year's $502 billion trade deficit. Chinese exports to the U.S. totaled some $388.1 billion last year.Anthony Ruggiero, an East Asia expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said China may be more willing to accommodate Trump on trade and economic issues than on regional security issues, including North Korea. Xi, a shrewd political operator, is unlikely to want to rock the boat ahead of a Communist Party conclave later this year that will install new leadership.Xi is also expected to seek assurances that Trump will not interfere in the territorial dispute over the South China Sea or question the ""One China"" policy by reaching out to Taiwan's leader again, as he did during the transition. The move infuriated Beijing, leading Trump to eventually reiterate his commitment to the decades-old policy.Previous White Houses have held China accountable for its human rights record, something this administration has made very little mention of, whether in China or elsewhere. It also remains to be seen whether the Obama administration's deal with Beijing to curb Chinese cybertheft for economic gain and its hacking of U.S. companies will be addressed._Follow Vivian Salama at http://twitter.com/vmsalama and Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC       President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with their wives, first lady Melania Trump and Chinese first lady Peng Liyuan are seated during a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Thursday, April 6, 2017, in Palm Beach, Fla.

The German capital is going nuts over the impossibly cute bears, who will be presented to the public at Berlin Zoo on July 6. Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping are also expected to visit the new animal stars ahead of the Group of 20 summit in Germany in early July. ""It was my personal wish to come and welcome our new residents,"" Mayor Michael Mueller said. ""We are delighted that Berlin has gained another fantastic attraction with these bears."" Jiao Qing, which means ""darling,"" is a 7-year-old male and weighs 108 kilograms (238 pounds). Female Meng Meng, which translates as ""sweet dream,"" is three years old and weighs 77 kilograms (169 pounds). The pandas were taken from the airport to the zoo with police protection so they didn't have to stop at any red lights. They also brought their own food on the plane - one metric ton of bamboo from China. Once they've chewed up all of that, the zoo will start importing special bamboo from the Netherlands. The furry couple will move into a ritzy new nine-million-euro ($10 million) compound, furbished with Chinese-style pavilions, red lanterns, a climbing area and a mountain landscape. They will be the only pandas in the country, the German news agency dpa reported. Expectations are high the two will have babies soon, even though Ochs warned that Meng Meng is not yet sexually mature. The arrival of the black-and-white bears was preceded by yearslong bilateral negotiations, since giant pandas are unique to China and sent abroad as diplomatic envoys. ""In China, pandas are regarded as a national treasure,"" Chinese ambassador Shi Mingde said. ""Therefore the breeding and conservation of these animals is a top priority for us."" The pandas will be on loan from China for 15 years - a deal for which the Asian country is charging 1 million euros ($1.1 million) each year, dpa reported. Berlin's last panda, Bao Bao, was sent in 1980 as a gift from then-Chinese leader Hua Guofeng to West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Bao Bao died in 2012.

The United States has turned its back on liberal values and is cozying up to Russia. And Europe, spurned by Washington and London, is turning to Beijing to fill the void.Welcome to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos circa 2017. This is not a dream. It is, or may be, the new reality in a world shaken by economic and geo-political tremors not seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall, or possibly World War Two.In past years, this annual gathering of leaders, CEOs and bankers in the Swiss Alps has had a glum undertone to it because of the succession of crises, mainly of a financial nature, rocking the globe.But this year there was a sense that something far bigger is going on, a shifting of the tectonic plates of global politics that is breeding deep uncertainty and may herald a return to a rougher, tougher world defined by national self interest.""Cautiously pessimistic"" is how Robin Niblett, director of the London-based think tank Chatham House described the mood.EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini spoke of a new paradigm in foreign policy.""We've been used to friendships, natural partnerships based mainly on values and history and probably we're entering into a phase where we will be maybe more pragmatic, transactional, some say emotionless,"" she told Reuters.Chinese President Xi Jinping stole the show in Davos with a speech that made it clear Beijing is eager to fill any vacuum in global leadership arising from the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House.His address to a vast, packed hall, in which he defended globalisation, free trade and multilateralism, was both diplomatic and opportunistic.Xi took indirect digs at Trump, only days before his inauguration. And he sent an unmistakable message to a rudderless Europe: China is here for you.EUROPE AND CHINA""The Chinese have seized the opportunity,"" said a senior European Commission official. ""They have developed such deep knowledge about us in the last 10 years that they know exactly how to tweak a message to a Western audience that is at a loss because of Brexit and Trump.""""Whichever way you look at it, the EU and China will have to lead on climate change,"" the official said. ""If we want to try to maintain a world economic model based on openness and free trade, it could be led by the EU and China if we do it smart.""This is a new world, Niblett said, in which the Europeans see Russia as a threat and China as an opportunity, while Trump sees China as a threat and Russia as an opportunity.But are we really there yet? Perhaps not. Much depends on Trump, who stayed away from Davos on the week of his inauguration but dominated discussions at the public panels, closed-door meetings and the off-record breakfasts and lunches.The questions about a Trump presidency fell into three main categories: How will the contradictions in his economic and foreign policies be resolved? Who will really have the say in his administration? And why that perplexing fondness for Vladimir Putin?""All Western leaders have had a moment of madness when they thought they could do a deal with Vladimir Putin,"" said one former leader of a Western country, predicting that Trump's cozy relationship with the Russian president would not last.A veteran of previous U.S. administrations predicted that members of Trump's cabinet would push back hard against many of his foreign policy plans.""We could end up in parallel universes, if you will, of real politics, real policies, real decisions that look pretty intelligent. And then a sort of public commenting, tweeting dialogue that continually raises eyebrows,"" that person said.DOLLAR DILEMMAOn economic policy, something will also have to give. During his presidential campaign, Trump accused the Federal Reserve of keeping interest rates too low for too long.Last month it began raising them on expectations of a pick-up in growth and inflation, spurred on by Trump's plan to spend on infrastructure and slash taxes.Now that is fuelling expectations of a rise in the dollar, and Trump is calling dollar strength a problem, a message echoed in Davos by Anthony Scaramucci, the one member of his team who made the trek to Switzerland.In Davos, David Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group described dollar strength as the most serious economic challenge of 2017, warning it could spur a 1990s-style emerging markets crisis as countries that have borrowed heavily in dollars are squeezed.""It would be ironic if Mexico had to be bailed out by the (Trump) administration"" because of its own policies, Rubenstein said to chuckles in the audience.Oddly, for a meeting that takes place in Europe and has traditionally lured leaders from across the EU, it was the Europeans that made the least noise, reduced to bystanders as Xi spelled out his vision and speculation swirled about Trump.Germany's Angela Merkel, described as the last defender of the western liberal democratic order after Trump's election, had signalled she would come but then decided against it.And so it was left to a few European ministers and EU commissioners to stand up for European values.To make matters worse, British Prime Minister Theresa May turned up and explained to everyone why leaving Europe would make Britain stronger.

Without reform, there will be no driving force; without opening up, there will be no progress.‘There is good news and I believe there will be more good news in the future.’He added China will ‘stand firm’ to protect intellectual property rights.Xi attributed the Chinese economy's recent slowdown to three factors: world economic problems, proactive Chinese efforts at regulation and ‘protracted structural problems’ in China.A big item of concern for the American CEOs is a treaty that would provide a framework for broader investment in the economy of each nation.

The agreements can help ensure the rights of foreign investors are protected and that foreign companies operate on a level playing field with domestic ones.An agreement with China could open up more of that nation's massive market to American companies, provide clearer rules for Chinese investment in the US, and create jobs in both countries, supporters say.‘The reason that the U.S. and China have a nearly $600 billion trading relationship, large amounts of U.S. investment in China, and increasing amounts of Chinese direct investment here, is because there are many areas where our national and business interests align,’ Paulson told Xi at the forum, according to AP.

He said China was a staunch defender of cybersecurity and also had been a victim of hacking.Acknowledging that the countries don't always see eye to eye, Xi said China is ready to set up a joint effort to fight cybercrimes.American officials say hacking attacks originating from China are approaching epidemic levels.A meeting on Tuesday with governors from five US states and local Chinese officials produced a deal to work on clean energy.

457,Hit Chinese propaganda film celebrates Ivanka Trump's shoe supplier despite the fact that the factory has been accused of serious labor abuses,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5680725/Amazing-China-documentary-fiction-fact.html," 02:14 BST, 2 May 2018 ","A Chinese company that manufactured Ivanka Trump shoes and has been accused of serious labor abuses is being celebrated in a blockbuster propaganda film for extending China's influence around the globe.The state-backed documentary 'Amazing China' portrays the Huajian Group as a beneficent force spreading prosperity - in this case, by hiring thousands of Ethiopians at wages a fraction of what they'd have to pay in China. But in Ethiopia, Huajian workers told The Associated Press they work without safety equipment for pay so low they can barely make ends meet.'I'm left with nothing at the end of the month,' said Ayelech Geletu, 21, who told the AP she earns a base monthly salary of 1,400 Birr ($51) at Huajian's factory in Lebu, outside Addis Ababa. 'Plus, their treatment is bad. They shout at us whenever they want.'         A factory that used to produce Ivanka Trump's shoe line features heavily in a new Chinese state-produced documentary about the country's growing economy. Above, workers at a Huajian shoe factory in China assemble women's shoes on September 14, 2016         Ivanka Trump's brand said it no longer does business with Huajian and 'has always and continues to take supply chain integrity very seriously'         The documentary leaves out the fact that the Huajian factory has been accused of several labor violations. Above, an exterior of the company's factory in Dukem, Ethiopia last month        With epic cinematography, 'Amazing China' - produced by China Central Television and the state-owned China Film Group Co. Ltd. - articulates a message of how China would like to be seen as it pursues President Xi Jinping's vision of a globally resurgent nation, against a reality that doesn't always measure up.China's ruling Communist Party recently announced it would take direct control of major broadcasters and assume regulatory power over everything from film and TV to books and news.As the party deepens its ability to cultivate 'unity of thought' among citizens, 'Amazing China' demonstrates the scope of China's propaganda machine, which not only crafted a stirring documentary about China's renaissance under Xi but also helped manufacture an adoring audience for it.The movie, which weaves together extraordinary feats of engineering and military, environmental and cultural achievements, hit theaters three days before China's rubber-stamp legislature convened to amend the constitution and allow Xi to potentially rule China for life.The star - noted by IMDb.com - is Xi himself, who appears more than 30 times in the 90-minute film.'Amazing China' presents Huajian as an inspiring example of China exporting the success of its own economic miracle by creating transformative jobs for thousands of poor Ethiopians and sharing China's knowledge, language and can-do discipline to build a new industrial foundation for Ethiopia's economy.         The documentary, Amazing China, has now become the second-highest grossing film of all time in the country          Experts say the film's success is due to the Communist party, which has bought tickets in bulk. Above, President Xi Jinping is featured in the film during an airing on March 22          In this photo from March 22, audience members watch a screening of the documentaryThe company is celebrated as a model of the inclusiveness at the heart of a much larger project: Xi's signature One Belt One Road initiative, a plan to spread Chinese infrastructure and influence across dozens of countries so ambitious in scope that it's been compared to the U.S.-led Marshall Plan after World War II.'In opening to the outside world, China's pursuit is not to only make our lives better, but to make the lives of others better,' the narrator says.In the film, Huajian chairman Zhang Huarong stands before neat rows of Ethiopian workers singing a song about unity, describing himself as a father to his employees, who 'like me very much.'But four current and former Huajian employees told the AP their wages were so low that they struggled to pay their bills. They said they had no protective gear, were forced to work 12 hours a day and participate in military-style physical drills, were not permitted to form a union and were regularly yelled at by their Chinese managers.All that made it hard for them to relate to the inspirational video about Huajian circulated by mobile phone with its sweeping shots of a gleaming factory and a soundtrack that repeats in operatic Mandarin: 'Huajian has come, Huajian has come ... holding the torch of hope.''If someone complains, he will be accused of disturbing the workplace and will be fired right away,' said Ebissa Gari, a 22-year-old who estimated he earns 960 Birr ($35) a month. 'That's why we keep quiet and work no matter how much we are subdued.'Getahun Alemu, a 20-year-old who quit Huajian last year to continue his studies, complained of inadequate safety gear.'There are chemicals that hurt our eyes and nose, and machines that cut our hands,' he said. 'They have no idea about hand gloves! If you refuse to work without that protective gear, then you will be told to leave the company.'Huajian declined the AP's requests for comment. Ivanka Trump's brand said it no longer does business with Huajian and 'has always and continues to take supply chain integrity very seriously.'Huajian's investment in Ethiopia was part of a government-led industrialization drive. In the last few years, Ethiopia's leaders and business allies came under intense criticism, with more than 300 businesses attacked by protesters who saw them as bolstering a repressive regime.         Workers at the company's factories in Ethiopia say they are paid far less than the minimum wage. Above, the Ethiopian factory in January 2017          The company moved much of its factories to Ethiopia to exploit the fact that the country has no legal minimum wage. Above, Huajian officials in 2015 show off the industrial zone being built on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia          Workers at the Ethiopia facilities say they aren't given safety gear and haven't been allowed to unionize. Above, the entrance to the Eastern Industry Zone outside Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on March 21These days, armed soldiers stand guard at the entrance to the Eastern Industrial Zone in Ethiopia's Oromia region, where Huajian opened its first factory.Six years after the company's arrival, the dream of turning Ethiopia into a shoe-manufacturing hub remains unrealized, and few harbor illusions about the main incentive for Huajian's investment in a country where there is no legal minimum wage.'These companies are moving out of Asia and coming to Africa to save labor costs,' said Fitsum Arega, who recently stepped down as head of the Ethiopian Investment Commission to become an adviser to the new prime minister. He praised Huajian for employing more than 5,000 Ethiopians, but said the company 'could have done better.''I'm not saying all employees are happy and there are no abuses here and there,' Arega said, adding that the government pushes companies to protect workers. 'There's a labor law which actually the companies say favors the employees.'The Chinese-owned Eastern Industrial Zone effectively took fertile land from Ethiopian farmers and handed it over to foreign investors - a strategy the Ethiopian government is rethinking, according to Nemera Mamo, a teaching fellow in economics at the University of London.'You can clearly see that these industrial zones are absolutely favorable to the Chinese investors, but not to the local communities or the local private investors,' he said. Huajian workers told the AP they made 960 Birr ($35) to 1,700 Birr ($62) a month. A basic living wage in Ethiopia is about 3,000 Birr ($109) a month, according to Ayele Gelan, a research economist at the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research.         Getahun Alemu, 20, a former employee of Huajian, poses for a photo in Dukem, Ethiopia on March 21. Alemu, who quit the China-based company in 2017 to continue his studies, complained of inadequate safety gearIn a post promoting 'Amazing China' on its official WeChat account, Huajian claimed to be Ethiopia's largest exporter - an exaggeration also promulgated by China's official Xinhua News Agency.Huajian is Ethiopia's largest shoe exporter, shipping out $19.3 million worth of goods last fiscal year, according to Ethiopia's Leather Industry Development Institute. But coffee producer Mullege PLC said it exported $42 million worth of coffee during the same period and that other companies export even more.Huajian's record within China also has been troubled. In at least five cases since 2015, Huajian sued workers in Chinese court rather than pay compensation mandated by a government arbitration panel. Huajian lost every case, court records show, and the court had to freeze Huajian's assets to get one worker the 44,174 yuan ($7,000) he was owed.Last year, Huajian found itself entangled in labor and human rights controversies that made global headlines but attracted little attention in China's official media. Three men working with the New York-based non-profit group China Labor Watch were arrested after their investigation of Ivanka Trump's suppliers zeroed in on Huajian.

Share this articleShare30 shares China Labor Watch founder Li Qiang said Huajian's factory in Ganzhou, in southeastern Jiangxi province, had some of the worst conditions he has ever encountered, including excessive overtime, low pay, and verbal and physical abuse.Huajian has called those allegations 'completely not true to the facts, taken out of context, exaggerated' and accused the investigators of conducting industrial espionage - a charge that was parroted in China's party-controlled media.Wei Tie, the director of 'Amazing China,' said he wasn't aware of the controversy surrounding Huajian until the AP informed him.Wei said he included the company in the film because it is 'introducing China's experience of prosperity to Africa.'He said he prefers to focus on the good. 'What I did was absorb the essence and discard the dross,' he said, citing a longstanding aphorism of Chinese political thought.At first glance, Wei's selective approach appears to have resonated with Chinese audiences. 'Amazing China' smashed box-office records for documentary films, raking in 456 million yuan ($72 million) in its first five weeks, according to ticketing website Maoyan.com. It even thumped 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi.'Wei attributed this success to the 'spontaneous feeling' of citizens inspired by the arc of tremendous progress they've witnessed, a national rejuvenation forged with sweat and skill that he compared to Europe's Renaissance and the pioneering days of the American republic.In Shanghai, midday screenings during the week sold out immediately, suggesting either unquenchable public appetite or organized bulk ticket sales.None of the viewers surveyed by AP had purchased their own tickets. Instead, they said they got them from state-run companies, neighborhood committees or government departments that handed them out as part of their 'party building work.'"

460,'Frog fans' of China's elder Jiang light up social media,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4992544/Frog-fans-Chinas-elder-Jiang-light-social-media.html," 11:29 BST, 18 October 2017 "," BEIJING (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping was at the podium giving a three-and-a-half hour speech to outline his grand vision for a ""new era"" of China. But for young Chinese cracking jokes on social media, all eyes were on their 91-year-old cult favorite struggling to stay awake in the front row. Jiang Zemin is dozing off. Jiang Zemin is using a magnifying glass the size of his head to read. Jiang Zemin is checking his watch for the umpteenth time - and Xi's barely halfway into his speech. China's internet flared up again on Wednesday with largely affectionate jokes about Jiang, the long-retired party leader who has stuck around and haunted Chinese politics despite perennial rumors of his demise. Some users noted how Jiang looked ""younger and younger"" as he emerged for Xi's speech in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.          Former Chinese President Jiang Zemin uses a magnifying glass to read a work report during the opening session of China's 19th Party Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2017. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday urged a reinvigorated Communist Party to take on a more forceful role in society and economic development to better address ""grim"" challenges facing the country as he opened a twice-a-decade national congress. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)  Jiang came to power in 1989 after the military's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. He's known for overseeing a four-fold expansion of the economy in the 1990s while reining-in civil liberties, including imposing a crackdown on followers of the Falun Gong, an outlawed spiritual movement. His human rights record doesn't seem to bother his young fans, who point instead to his frequent stunts - reciting the Gettysburg Address in a 60 Minutes interview or floating in the Dead Sea during a Middle East visit with spandex shorts clinging to his pot belly - as evidence of an unscripted political legend. Today he's the closest thing there is to a living, breathing Communist Party internet meme. His fans call him ""frog"" - because of his grin and signature, oversized glasses - and label themselves ""frog worshippers"" or ""frog fans."" Others wryly call him ""elder,"" a reference to his famous 2000 diatribe in which he tried to scold a young Hong Kong reporter by referring to her as ""too young,"" ''too simple, sometimes naive"" in English. When he turned 90 last year, the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat was filled with well wishes from millennials who were in third grade when Jiang left power. The fascination with Jiang has unsettled authorities, even if it's unclear whether the sentiment is sardonic or earnest. Jiang's name is often censored in internet searches, and even pictures of frogs are sometimes deleted. The former party chief has also been rumored to clash heavily with Xi behind the scenes over his lingering influence. Authorities removed one blog post that said it was reassuring that Jiang ""looks so healthy"" on Wednesday, while searches of his name did not return results on Weibo and popular online forums.

461,China's Xi visits Italy with Belt and Road deal as prize,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6835751/Chinese-visit-Italy-seeks-closer-ties-stirs-suspicions.html," 16:51 BST, 21 March 2019 "," MILAN (AP) - At the heart of Chinese President Xi Jingping's visit to Rome that started Thursday is a key prize: a deal to make Italy the first major democracy to join China's ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has pledged to sign a memorandum of understanding with China on Saturday, despite Western concerns about Beijing's growing economic clout. Italy's allies and some within the country's coalition government also think the Belt and Road deal could give China more political influence in Europe and the West. But Xi's visit, at the invitation of Italian President Sergio Mattarella, also has a broader aim of deepening trade and cultural ties. Conte has even suggested that Italy could play a role in easing trade tensions between China and the United States. Xi and his wife, Peng Liuan, arrived at Rome's main Fiumicino airport on Thursday evening. The Chinese president's itinerary includes meeting with Mattarella and attending a wreath-laying at Italy's monument for unknown soldiers on Friday. Here's a look what's at stake in the visit, which ends on Sunday: ____          Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan arrive at Rome's Leonardo Da Vinci airport in Fiumicino, Italy, Thursday, March 21, 2019. Jinping is in Italy to sign a memorandum of understanding to make Italy the first Group of Seven leading democracies to join China's ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure project. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)  INFRASTRUCTURE Italy's signature on the ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure-building project would give legitimacy to a project that envisions overland and maritime routes connecting China with Europe, reviving the old Silk Road traveled by Marco Polo in the Middle Ages. The initiative encompasses about 60 countries through Asia and Africa to Europe. Conte has dismissed concerns that signing the framework with China would downgrade Italy's strategic ties with Europe and the United States, saying its focus was more commercial and on encouraging trade with China. The White House has criticized the deal, saying it is weighted in China's interests. Italy's European allies have declined to sign a joint declaration on the ""Belt and Road,"" saying it lacks standards on financing and transparency. While full details have not been released, it reportedly includes collaboration and investments in the northern Italian ports of Genoa and Trieste as well as roads, railways, airports and telecommunications. ""Our two countries may harness our historical and cultural bonds forged through the ancient Silk Road,"" Xi wrote in the Corriere della Sera newspaper this week. ____ TECHNOLOGY Key Italian officials have insisted that the issue of expanding Chinese company Huawei's 5G network into Italy is not part of the ""Belt and Road"" memorandum. The Chinese 5-G network is viewed with suspicion, mainly by the U.S. government, which says it could give Chinese security services a backdoor to snoop on consumers. The issue is a major source of tension between China and the U.S. While European countries have balked at banning Huawei outright from participating in the creation of the new 5G networks, one key member of Italy's government, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, shares the concerns, saying nothing in the memorandum can threaten Italians' data. ____ CULTURE Ahead of the visit, Xi noted that China and Italy are the countries with the largest number of UNESCO world heritage sites, sharing both cultural and tourism resources. He suggested that the two countries could form ""twinning relationships"" between world heritage sites and cooperate on art exhibitions, TV and movie production, language course and travel. Mattarella said that the heritage of Italy and China both ""arouse admiration around the world"" and could help develop the economy. The two countries are expected to soon announce the pairing of the Langhe, Roero and Monferrato wine region in Piedmont with China's Honghe Hani rice terraces, while Verona and Hangzhou are to establish sister-city relationships. Culture and tourism officials will be meeting Saturday on the sidelines of Xi's visit. ____ TRADE Conte said he aims to rebalance trade with China. Currently 1 billion Chinese consumers provide a market for 13 billion euros (nearly $15 billion) in Italian goods, while Italy's 60 million people buy 60 billion euros in Chinese-made products each year. Italy's undersecretary for economic development, Michele Geraci, says Italy lags its European partners in trade with China by 15 or 20 years, and that the aim is to increase Italian exports to China by 7 billion euros, putting Italy in line with France. Mattarella said that Italy sees China ""not only as an economic partner of prime importance, but also as a driver of global trade,"" and a market for Italian technology and expertise in areas like environmental protection, food security, health services and machinery. He called for ""open and transparent"" trade with both countries acting ""on an equal basis."" Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wang Chao said the ""Belt and Road"" deal would be beneficial for both countries' economic development and trade. However, Francois Godement, a specialist in Chinese politics at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, called such claims ""bogus,"" because Chinese companies already have significant investments in Italy. ____ This story has been corrected to show that Xi Jingping is China's president, not premier. ___ Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this report.

462,Ghost cities haunt stability dream in far west China,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4847964/Ghost-cities-haunt-stability-dream-far-west-China.html," 08:05 BST, 3 September 2017 ","          Dubbed ""Shenzhen City"" after the bustling southern port city that financed it, the more than 200,000 square metre development is part of a government project to stabilise Xinjiang with massive economic stimulus  The future of economic development in China's far western Xinjiang region lies behind the shattered glass door of a welcome centre on the outskirts of the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar. Inside, a dusty model depicts a modern urban development with wide, tree-lined boulevards and a pair of twin skyscrapers -- but outside the project remains a ghost town reflecting Beijing's struggle to bring prosperity to the restless region. Dubbed ""Shenzhen City"" after the bustling southern port city that financed it, the more than 200,000 square metre development is part of a government project to stabilise Xinjiang with massive economic stimulus. Beijing has paired promises of wealth with strict controls on personal and religious freedoms in an effort to quell ethnic strife between the country's Han Chinese majority and the region's mostly Muslim Uighur minority. But outside the welcome centre, where a broken LED sign flashed out an investment hotline number like an SOS, the plan for a vibrant oasis on the western edge of the Taklamakan desert stood like a mirage. The landmark buildings' half-finished silhouettes jut out of a rubble-strewn construction site, surrounded by withered trees and grass.          A girl playing with a piece of plastic in front of a construction site in a development called 'Shenzhen City' on the outskirts of Kashgar in China's western Xinjiang province  Several such ambitious projects around Kashgar have stagnated despite government plans to bring the poverty-stricken region's economy on par with the rest of the nation. To do so, Shenzhen and 18 of the country's other wealthiest cities and provinces have been required to pump a fraction of their GDP into Xinjiang under a ""pairing assistance"" programme. The rationale is ""if you can improve people's economic conditions, they will become less politically restive,"" said Enze Han, a lecturer on politics at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies. But ""if you look at the ground, the story in Xinjiang is a failure,"" he said. - 'Pairing assistance' - In 2010, a year after deadly riots in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi killed around 200 people, authorities rolled out the ""pairing assistance"" programme to raise the region's per capita GDP to the national average within five years.          Workers carry scaffolding past a construction site in a development called 'Shenzhen City' on the outskirts of Kashgar in China's western Xinjiang province  By the end of 2015, cities such as Beijing and Shanghai had invested some $8.5 billion in the region, according to the official Xinhua news agency. But President Xi Jinping shifted the focus back to security in 2014 after Uighurs perpetrated a series of violent attacks across the country, killing dozens. Two years later, the gap between Xinjiang and the rest of the country had only grown, with its per capita GDP expanding about 18 percent more slowly than the nation as a whole during the five-year period after the assistance programme began, according to calculations by AFP using government statistics. - 'Stability maintenance problems' - Another project lies largely abandoned across town: Guangzhou New City, a 1.5 million square metre ""urban centre"" in suburban Kashgar funded by the wealthy southern province of the same name.          An empty street in Guangzhou New City, a 1.5 million square metre 'urban centre' on the outskirts of Kashgar in China's western Xinjiang province  In late June, Michael Jackson music blared from speakers around the complex, where rubbish piled up in front of empty store fronts covered in fading ""for rent"" signs. Toilets in the men's bathroom were still wrapped in their original cellophane. When the development opened in 2012, promotional materials promised 20,000 jobs and housing for up to 80,000 people, roughly 15 percent of Kashgar's population. But local officials had to beg businessmen to come, said Lal Muhammad, a Pakistani trader, who signed a three-year lease for $1,000, which he soon abandoned. ""Few people came. Very few,"" he said, adding that the ubiquitous police checkpoints encircling the city had made it difficult for customers to come and go. ""The project is a flop."" There is no easy answer as to why the Kashgar projects have stumbled. Ji Yeon Hong, a Xinjiang expert at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said that while fears of violence deter economic investment and development, the projects ""seem unrelated to what the local population needs.""          Guangzhou New City, a 1.5 million square metre ""urban centre"" in suburban Kashgar funded by the wealthy southern province of the same name  Shenzhen City was stopped because its ""prospects were not good,"" a project manager surnamed Yang told AFP without elaborating. But a 2014 prospectus by the Shum Yip Group, a company involved in the development, said ""frequent terrorist violence"" made it difficult to attract labour or businesses. ""Some shops have closed because of Kashgar's stability maintenance problems,"" said Zou Zebin, the owner of a high-end furniture store, one of the few remaining shops in Guangzhou New City. Xinjiang's ever stricter security may also be negatively affecting businesses, according to Adrian Zenz, an expert on Chinese security at Germany's European School of Culture and Theology. ""Regular businesses and manufacturing there are no longer competitive due to the added expenses caused by security measures,"" he said. But Zou believes the ""cities"" can still replicate their namesakes' success, as Kashgar is a key part of China's One Belt, One Road initiative, a massive global infrastructure project to revive the ancient Silk Road. ""The country's investment in Xinjiang is really big,"" Zou said. ""I think in three years, we'll see the benefits."""
463,China flexes military muscle in Hong Kong during Xi's visit,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4653952/China-flexes-military-muscle-Hong-Kong-Xis-visit.html," 10:57 BST, 30 June 2017 "," HONG KONG (AP) - President Xi Jinping inspected troops based in Hong Kong on Friday as he asserted China's authority over the former British colony, where anti-China sentiment has been on the rise since Beijing took control 20 years ago. Xi rode in an open-top jeep past rows of soldiers lined up on an airstrip on his visit to the People's Liberation Army garrison. He called out ""Salute all the comrades"" and ""Salute to your dedication"" as he passed 3,100 soldiers arranged in 20 formations. Armored personnel carriers, combat vehicles, helicopters and other pieces of military hardware were arrayed behind the troops.          Chinese President Xi Jinping inspects Chinese troops of People's Liberation Army (PLA) Hong Kong Garrison at the Shek Kong Barracks in Hong Kong, Friday, June 30, 2017. Xi landed in Hong Kong Thursday to mark the 20th anniversary of Beijing taking control of the former British colony, accompanied by a formidable layer of security as authorities showed little patience for pro-democracy protests. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)  It was a rare display of the Chinese military's might in Hong Kong, where it normally maintains a low-key presence. China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, is expected to make a port call next month. Xi, who's also chairman of the Central Military Commission, wore a buttoned-up black jacket in the steamy heat during his 10-minute review of troops at the Shek Kong base in Hong Kong's suburban New Territories. It was part of a visit to mark the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover, when Britain gave up control of the Asian financial hub to China on July 1, 1997. Hong Kong was granted the freedom to run most of its affairs after it came under China's control under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. However, Beijing is in charge of the city's defense and foreign affairs. Troops deployed from the mainland are typically confined to bases scattered across town and at headquarters downtown. Hong Kongers aren't allowed to join up. Apart from trying to drum up Chinese national pride, the military display also served as a warning to groups expressing anti-China sentiment or pushing for independence, said Willy Lam, a political analyst at Chinese University of Hong Kong. The message is that ""when all else fails the PLA will always be the last resort. This, I think, would get people quite worried,"" Lam said. ""The implications are quite scary."" Xi's three-day visit to mark the anniversary includes presiding at the inauguration Saturday of the city's new leader, Carrie Lam. Security has been tight for his visit as authorities brace for protests. Police arrested 26 people, including young activist leader Joshua Wong, after they climbed onto a giant flower sculpture symbolizing Hong Kong's ""reunification"" with China on Wednesday. The department said they were later released on bail without charge but are required to report back to police in September. Some were held for more than 30 hours. Pro-democracy supporters fear Beijing is tightening its grip on Hong Kong and undermining guarantees of wide autonomy under ""one country, two systems."" Nathan Law, a former student protest leader elected to Hong Kong's semi-democratic legislature last year, was among those arrested. The action at the statue ""aimed to show that for the past 20 years, our human rights, our freedom, our democracy have deteriorated,"" Law told reporters Friday. Another activist, Avery Ng of the League of Social Democrats, said authorities appeared to be increasingly using ""thugs"" in addition to regular police to intimidate and harass the opposition. Unknown men followed him and at least one other person after their release and refused to identify themselves when confronted, he said. U.S. officials said they were concerned that China's Communist leaders weren't sticking to their promises. ""Looking ahead to the remaining 30 years of 'one country, two systems,' we cannot allow Hong Kong to go the way of Beijing's failed authoritarianism,"" U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, said in a statement. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Hong Kong was strictly China's domestic affair and rejected all outside expressions of concern. The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration laying terms for Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule is ""no longer relevant today, and has no binding force on the Chinese central government's governance over Hong Kong,"" Lu said. ""The U.K. has no sovereignty, governance right or the right of supervision over today's Hong Kong. We hope the relevant people can be aware of the reality,"" Lu said. ___ Associated Press writer Christopher Bodeen contributed to this report.

464,"China, 20 other countries initiate new Asian bank",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2805943/China-21-countries-initiate-new-Asian-bank.html," 11:13 BST, 24 October 2014 ","China, 20 other countries initiate new Asian bank By Associated Press   Published: 11:13 BST, 24 October 2014  |  Updated: 11:13 BST, 24 October 2014                e-mail         BEIJING (AP) — Twenty-one Asian nations have signed on to a China-driven initiative to create a new development bank for Asia that's aimed at boosting infrastructure investment of all kinds. Beijing sees that as a way to raise its international standing, but Washington opposes the move as an unnecessary and potentially damaging rival to established institutions such as the World Bank.— WHO'S IN THE GROUP?Members are overwhelmingly developing nations, with Singapore the only advanced economy. The others range from economic powerhouses India and China to smaller but economically dynamic nations such as Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines and Mongolia. A few are drawn from among the poorest nations including Laos, Cambodia and Oman.        Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei gives a speech during the signing ceremony of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing Friday, Oct. 24, 2014. China and 21 other Asian nations have signed on to the new international bank opposed by Washington as an unnecessary rival to established institutions such as the World Bank.(AP Photo/Takaki Yajima, Pool) Others taking part are Uzbekistan, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Qatar, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Brunei, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Malaysia and Myanmar.Just as important is who's not in the group: Solid American allies Japan, South Korea and Australia, although they, along with the U.S. may enter at a later date if the venture proves to be a success. Although Singapore is a close U.S. ally, its officials say entering now will give them a chance to make a positive impact on the way the bank plans to do business.— SO WHAT'S WASHINGTON'S VIEW?The U.S. is concerned that the new bank will introduce laxer standards for lending when it comes to environmental and labor protection, transparency of the project bidding process, and human rights. Washington worries that could undercut existing institutions like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank that have sought to impose standards to promote good governance, fair labor practices and a clean environment.Naturally, Washington is also concerned about any move by China to shift attention away from institutions that it and its allies dominate. The world's first and second biggest economies deeply distrust each other and are locked in a ceaseless competition for pre-eminence in Asia, where the U.S. is the dominant military power but China's massive economy carries enormous heft.— HOW MUCH CAN IT LEND?China says it's willing to pony up just about all of the $50 billion to capitalize the bank, while other institutions and private lenders are expected to provide another $50 billion. That $100 billion is still relatively small compared with existing institutions. The World Bank's capital is about $220 billion, while the Asian Development Bank has $175 billion capital.However, China appears inclined to streamline the lending process, meaning countries may not have to wait as long or jump through as many hoops to get their money. That could stimulate borrowing all-around if it ends up competing with existing institutions for business.— WHAT'S IN IT FOR CHINA?The bank is in large part China's reaction to being constantly relegated to second-class status at existing institutions. China is also backing another alternative institution, the New Development Bank, sponsored by the so-called BRICS countries that also include Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa.The idea is that if the U.S. and other major powers won't make room for China at the table, then Beijing will make its own. China also hopes the bank will improve its global stature and end what it views as the West's bullying and discrimination in the political and economic spheres.In addition, the bank is expected to bring solid economic benefits to China, whose companies already benefit massively from policy loans offered abroad by the country's state banks. They can expect to pick up port, railway and telecommunications contracts for projects tied to China's oft-mentioned dream of restoring ancient Silk Road trade links to Europe. The bank could also absorb some of China's $3.89 trillion in foreign currency reserves.— WHAT NEED DOES IT SERVE?Asia needs infrastructure development. A lot of it. The world bank estimates that $8 trillion in spending is required between 2010 and 2020 just to keep Asian economies humming along. Only a tiny slice of that can now be provided by the Asian Development Bank and other institutional lenders, so the AIIB hopes to help fill some of those enormous gaps.At the very least, the AIIB ought to give borrowers more options and could put pressure on the World Bank and others to streamline their heavily bureaucratic operations, which often take years to process loan requests. By its multinational nature, it could also pressure China's banks to shape up their operations and help defray some of the resentment that has built up toward Beijing among borrowers who feel burned by the terms of their loans from Chinese state banks.""In China we have a folk saying. If you would like to get rich, build roads first, and I believe that is a very vivid description of the very importance of infrastructure to economic development,"" Chinese President Xi Jinping told participants after the signing ceremony.

465,"For Chinese millennials, despondency has a brand name",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4852344/For-Chinese-millennials-despondency-brand-name.html," 00:05 BST, 5 September 2017 "," By Yawen Chen and Tony Munroe BEIJING, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Chinese millennials with a dim view of their career and marriage prospects can wallow in despair with a range of teas such as ""achieved-absolutely-nothing black tea"", and ""my-ex's-life-is-better-than-mine fruit tea"". While the drink names at the Sung chain of tea stalls are tongue-in-cheek, the sentiment they reflect is serious: a significant number of young Chinese with high expectations have become discouraged and embrace an attitude known on social media as ""sang"", after a Chinese character associated with the word ""funeral"" that describes being dispirited. ""Sang"" culture, which revels in often-ironic defeatism, is fuelled by internet celebrities, through music and the popularity of certain mobile games and TV shows, as well as sad-faced emojis and pessimistic slogans. It's a reaction to cut-throat competition for good jobs in an economy that isn't as robust as it was a few years ago and when home-ownership - long seen as a near-requirement for marriage in China - is increasingly unattainable in major cities as apartment prices have soared. ""I wanted to fight for socialism today but the weather is so freaking cold that I'm only able to lay on the bed to play on my mobile phone,"" 27 year-old Zhao Zengliang, a ""sang"" internet personality, wrote in one post. ""It would be great if I could just wake up to retirement tomorrow,"" she said in another. Such ironic humour is lost on China's ruling Communist Party. In August, Sung Tea was called out for peddling ""mental opium"" by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, which described sang culture in an editorial as ""an extreme, pessimistic and hopeless attitude that's worth our concern and discussion"". ""Stand up, and be brave. Refuse to drink 'sung tea', choose to walk the right path, and live the fighting spirit of our era,"" it said. China´s State Council Information Office did not reply to a request for comment for this story. While ""sang"" can be a pose or affectation, despondency among a segment of educated young people is a genuine concern for President Xi Jinping and his government, which prizes stability. The intensifying censorship clampdown on media and cyberspace in the run-up to autumn's Communist Party congress, held once every five years, extends even to negativity, with regulations issued in early June calling for ""positive energy"" in online audiovisual content. Later that month, some young netizens were frustrated when Bojack Horseman, an animated American TV series about a half-man/half-horse former sitcom star, and popular among the ""sang"" generation for his self-loathing and cynicism, was pulled from Chinese streaming site iQiyi. ""Screw positive energy,"" Vincent, a 27-year old Weibo user, commented under a post announcing the news. A spokesperson at iQiyi said the decision to remove Bojack Horseman was due to ""internal process issues"" but declined to give further details. Social media and online gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd has even gone on the counterattack against ""sang"" culture. It has launched an ad campaign around the Chinese word ""ran"" - which literally means burning and conveys a sense of optimism - with slogans such as ""every adventure is a chance to be reborn."" ONLY-CHILD BLUES Undermining ""sang"" may take some doing. ""Sang"" is also a rebellion against the striving of contemporary urban China, no matter the cost or hopes of achieving a goal. Tied to that is intense social and family pressure to succeed, which typically comes with the expectation that as members of the one-child generation people will support ageing parents and grandparents. Zhao's online posts, often tinged with dark humour, have attracted almost 50,000 fans on microblogging site Weibo. Zhao turned the subject into a book last year: ""A Life Where You Can't Strive for Success All The Time"". While China's roughly 380 million millennials - or those aged about 18 to 35 - have opportunities that earlier generations would have found unimaginable, they also have expectations that are becoming harder to meet. The average starting salary for college graduates dropped by 16 percent this year to 4,014 yuan ($608) per month amid intensifying competition for jobs as a record 8 million graduate from Chinese universities - nearly ten times the number in 1997. Even among elite ""sea turtles"" - those who return after studying overseas, often at great expense - nearly half of 2017 graduates earned less than 6,000 yuan per month, a Zhaopin.com survey found, with 70 percent of respondents saying their pay is ""far below"" expectations. Home-ownership is a nearly universal aspiration in China, but it is increasingly difficult to get on the property ladder in big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. An average two-bedroom home in Beijing's resale market costs around 6 million yuan ($909,835)after prices surged 36.7 percent in 2016, according to Fang.com, China's biggest real estate website. That's about 70 times the average per capita disposable income in the city; the ratio is less than 25 times for New York City. Median per person rent in Beijing, where most of the estimated 8 million renters are millennials, according to Ziroom.com, has risen 33 percent in the past five years to 2,748 yuan a month in June, equivalent to 58 percent of median income in the city, a survey by E-House China R&amp;D Institute found. The costs often mean that young Chinese workers have to live on the edges of cities, with long, stressful journeys to work. Financial pressures also contribute to young Chinese waiting longer to get married. In Nanjing, a major eastern city, the median age for first marriages rose to 31.6 last year, from 29.9 in 2012, official data showed. RISING EXPECTATIONS ""Sang"" contrasts with the optimism of those who entered adulthood during the years of China's double-digit economic growth in previous decades. That generation was motivated by career prospects and life quality expectations that their parents and grandparents, who had learned to ""eat bitter"" during tougher times, could only dream of. ""Our media and society have shoved too many success stories down our throat,"" said Zhao. ""'Sang' is a quiet protest against society's relentless push for achieving the traditional notion of success. It is about admitting that you just can't make it,"" she told Reuters. It is also a symptom of the lack of channels for frustrated young adults to vent frustration, a survey of 200 Chinese university students by researchers at state think tank Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) found in June. ""The internet itself is a channel for them to release pressure but due to censorship it's impossible to do so by openly venting,"" Xiao Ziyang, a CASS researcher, told Reuters. ""It's necessary for the government to exercise public opinion control to prevent social problems."" Sung Tea founder Xiang Huanzhong, 29, said he expects pressure on young Chinese adults only to grow, citing the aging of the population as a particular burden for the young. Xiang has capitalised on the trend with products named after popular ""sang"" phrases. The chain has single locations in 12 cities after opening its first permanent tea stall in July in Beijing, where a best-selling ""sitting-around-and-waiting-to-die"" matcha milk tea costs 18 yuan. Xiang said he chose tame names for his products so as not to attract censure from authorities, leaning towards the self-deprecating. He took issue with the People's Daily's critical editorial. ""It didn't try to seriously understand at all,"" he said. Wang Hanqi, 21, a student at Nanjing Audit University, sought out Sung Tea after hearing about it on social media. ""I'm a bit disappointed that the names for the tea are not 'sang' enough,"" he said in an interview outside the Beijing stall.

But both sides remain political rivals, with China viewing the democratic island as a renegade province.Taiwan's pride in its democracy helps reinforce the unwillingness of many to be absorbed politically by China, which has not ruled out force to ensure unification.Thousands of young people occupied Taiwan's parliament in March last year in an unprecedented protest against a planned trade pact calling for closer ties with Beijing.But the KMT, the party of Chiang Kai-shek that retreated to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, is perceived as being pro-China. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is seen as leaning towards independence.It will be the first visit to Beijing by Chu since he took the reins of the KMT after it suffered a heavy setback in local elections last November.This trip is expected to bolster Chu's influence.

(AP) - What was billed as a showdown between the leaders of the United States and China over trade and North Korea ended with little sign of confrontation Friday - or of concrete progress in resolving their differences.President Donald Trump had predicted a ""very difficult"" meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. After their first face-to-face at the Mar-a-Lago resort, he trumpeted they had developed an ""outstanding"" relationship.U.S. officials said the two sides agreed to increase cooperation on trying to get North Korea's to abandon its nuclear weapons program, and China acknowledged the need for more balanced trade with the U.S.       President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with their wives, first lady Melania Trump and Chinese first lady Peng Liyuan are seated during a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Thursday, April 6, 2017, in Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)But the two days of meetings appeared heavier on optics than substance. The most powerful message for the Chinese leader may have been Trump's decision to launch U.S. missile strikes at Syria.Those strikes added weight to Trump's threat last week to act unilaterally against North Korea's weapons program - although a much heavier risk would be required to take military action against the nuclear-armed North, which has its artillery and missiles trained on a key U.S. ally, South Korea.The U.S. administration's first recourse is very likely to be economic - pushing China to crack down on Chinese banks and companies said to provide North Korea access to the international financial system.In a possible harbinger of the kind of punishments Washington could inflict, a leading Chinese telecoms company, ZTE, was fined nearly $900 million in March for shipping sensitive U.S.-made technology to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.""They recognize that shows our clear determination to crack down on this sort of activity,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told reporters.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. and China ""agreed to increase cooperation and work with the international community to convince the DPRK to peacefully resolve the issue and abandon its illicit weapons programs."" DPRK stands for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Tillerson said Trump and Xi noted the urgency of the threat of North Korea's weapons program and that they reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearization of the divided Korean Peninsula.On trade issues, Trump called for China to ""level the playing field"" for American workers, stressing the need for reciprocal market access. He also noted the importance of protecting human rights, and asked China to adhere to international norms in the seas of East Asia, Tillerson said.As a candidate and president, Trump has taken an aggressive posture toward China, labeling Beijing a ""tremendous problem"" and arguing that lopsided trade deals with China shortchange American businesses and workers. Some $347 billion of the $502 billion trade deficit recorded by the U.S. last year was with China.Trump said in a brief appearance before reporters Friday that he and Xi made ""tremendous progress"" in their talks and that he believes ""lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away."" He did not elaborate.For Xi, who is entering a twice-a-decade Communist Party congress in the fall, the meeting with Trump was more about stabilizing the critical U.S.-China relationship and burnishing his foreign policy credentials than achieving a breakthrough. The only other foreign leader to be hosted at Mar-a-Lago during Trump's presidency so far is Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a close U.S. ally.Speaking alongside Trump, Xi said the two delegations discussed important topics and established a good friendship and working relationship. He noted the historic responsibility of both countries - the world's largest economies and emerging military rivals - to work toward peace and stability.The visit was overshadowed by the missile barrage aimed at Syria, announced shortly after Trump and Xi wrapped up dinner Thursday night. The strikes were retaliation against Syrian President Bashar Assad for a chemical weapons attack against civilians caught up in his country's long civil war.China's response was muted. Its U.N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, never mentioned the suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria, or the U.S. airstrikes, at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday. Liu focused instead on the need for a political solution to the six-year Syrian conflict.___Pennington reported from Washington.Follow Vivian Salama at http://twitter.com/vmsalama       President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands during a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Thursday, April 6, 2017, in Palm Beach, Fla.

He has taken control of an unusually wide range of political, economic and other functions, a break with the past two decades of collective leadership. His image dominates official propaganda, which has prompted suggestions Xi is trying to build a cult of personality, evoking memories of the upheaval of the 1960s and '70s. Party spokespeople reject such talk, insisting Xi is the core of its seven-member Standing Committee, not a lone strongman. Xi's name and a political theory attributed to him were added to the party constitution this week, making him only the third Chinese leader cited by name after Mao and Deng Xiaoping, who launched economic reform in 1979. A reference to Deng Xiaoping Theory, or ""socialism with Chinese characteristics,"" was added only after the late leader's death. A party spokesman said Xi's status was justified due to his ""significant contribution"" to ideology. ""Using the names of party leaders for theory or guiding ideology is common practice in the international communist movement. For example, Marxism, Leninism, or our country has Mao Zedong Thought or Deng Xiaoping Theory,"" said spokesman Wang Xiaohui at a televised news conference. ""Xi Jinping's 'socialism with Chinese characteristics in a new era' is the crystallization of the wisdom of the party and the masses,"" said Wang. ""He made a significant contribution to the creation of this theory,"" said Wang. ""So use of his name on this theory is deserved."" On Thursday, Xi's face was splashed across the covers of Chinese magazines, while newspapers showed him with other members of the new Standing Committee appointed Wednesday. ""The Xi Jinping Era,"" said the headline on Vista magazine, published by the ruling party newspaper in the Ningxia region in the northwest. Political phrases associated with Xi's two most predecessors - Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao - were added to the party constitution but not their names. Xi serves as party leader, president of China and commander-in-chief of the military, as well as leader of party bodies in charge of economic reform, national security, internet security, foreign affairs and financial regulation. Xi has steadily tightened central control over the party and led a marathon anti-corruption crackdown that has snared potential rivals and successors. ___ This story has been corrected to show that newspapers displayed pictures of the Standing Committee while Xi was on magazine covers.

Brazil is among a few countries that run an overall trade surplus with China thanks to major exports of agriculture products, minerals and oil. The country exported $1.75 billion worth of meat to China in 2016, with chicken and beef accounting for the overwhelming majority, according to a statement on the agriculture ministry's website that repeated Maggi's statements.

In June, Panama upgraded its commercial ties with China and established full diplomatic links with the second most important customer of its key shipping canal, giving Beijing a major victory as it broke formal relations with Taiwan. The Foreign Ministry said the agreements will provide the basis for attracting investments and Chinese innovation to Panama, and help boost Panamanian exports, tourism and the use of the Panama canal.

488,"INSIGHT-For Chinese millennials, despondency has a brand name",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4852972/INSIGHT-For-Chinese-millennials-despondency-brand-name.html," 07:05 BST, 5 September 2017 "," By Yawen Chen and Tony Munroe BEIJING, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Chinese millennials with a dim view of their career and marriage prospects can wallow in despair with a range of teas such as ""achieved-absolutely-nothing black tea"", and ""my-ex's-life-is-better-than-mine fruit tea"". While the drink names at the Sung chain of tea stalls are tongue-in-cheek, the sentiment they reflect is serious: a significant number of young Chinese with high expectations have become discouraged and embrace an attitude known on social media as ""sang"", after a Chinese character associated with the word ""funeral"" that describes being dispirited. ""Sang"" culture, which revels in often-ironic defeatism, is fuelled by internet celebrities, through music and the popularity of certain mobile games and TV shows, as well as sad-faced emojis and pessimistic slogans. It's a reaction to cut-throat competition for good jobs in an economy that isn't as robust as it was a few years ago and when home-ownership - long seen as a near-requirement for marriage in China - is increasingly unattainable in major cities as apartment prices have soared. ""I wanted to fight for socialism today but the weather is so freaking cold that I'm only able to lay on the bed to play on my mobile phone,"" 27 year-old Zhao Zengliang, a ""sang"" internet personality, wrote in one post. ""It would be great if I could just wake up to retirement tomorrow,"" she said in another. Such ironic humour is lost on China's ruling Communist Party. In August, Sung Tea was called out for peddling ""mental opium"" by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, which described sang culture in an editorial as ""an extreme, pessimistic and hopeless attitude that's worth our concern and discussion"". ""Stand up, and be brave. Refuse to drink 'sung tea', choose to walk the right path, and live the fighting spirit of our era,"" it said. China´s State Council Information Office did not reply to a request for comment for this story. While ""sang"" can be a pose or affectation, despondency among a segment of educated young people is a genuine concern for President Xi Jinping and his government, which prizes stability. The intensifying censorship clampdown on media and cyberspace in the run-up to autumn's Communist Party congress, held once every five years, extends even to negativity, with regulations issued in early June calling for ""positive energy"" in online audiovisual content. Later that month, some young netizens were frustrated when Bojack Horseman, an animated American TV series about a half-man/half-horse former sitcom star, and popular among the ""sang"" generation for his self-loathing and cynicism, was pulled from Chinese streaming site iQiyi. ""Screw positive energy,"" Vincent, a 27-year old Weibo user, commented under a post announcing the news. A spokesperson at iQiyi said the decision to remove Bojack Horseman was due to ""internal process issues"" but declined to give further details. Social media and online gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd has even gone on the counterattack against ""sang"" culture. It has launched an ad campaign around the Chinese word ""ran"" - which literally means burning and conveys a sense of optimism - with slogans such as ""every adventure is a chance to be reborn."" ONLY-CHILD BLUES Undermining ""sang"" may take some doing. ""Sang"" is also a rebellion against the striving of contemporary urban China, no matter the cost or hopes of achieving a goal. Tied to that is intense social and family pressure to succeed, which typically comes with the expectation that as members of the one-child generation people will support ageing parents and grandparents. Zhao's online posts, often tinged with dark humour, have attracted almost 50,000 fans on microblogging site Weibo. Zhao turned the subject into a book last year: ""A Life Where You Can't Strive for Success All The Time"". While China's roughly 380 million millennials - or those aged about 18 to 35 - have opportunities that earlier generations would have found unimaginable, they also have expectations that are becoming harder to meet. The average starting salary for college graduates dropped by 16 percent this year to 4,014 yuan ($608) per month amid intensifying competition for jobs as a record 8 million graduate from Chinese universities - nearly ten times the number in 1997. Even among elite ""sea turtles"" - those who return after studying overseas, often at great expense - nearly half of 2017 graduates earned less than 6,000 yuan per month, a Zhaopin.com survey found, with 70 percent of respondents saying their pay is ""far below"" expectations. Home-ownership is a nearly universal aspiration in China, but it is increasingly difficult to get on the property ladder in big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. An average two-bedroom home in Beijing's resale market costs around 6 million yuan ($909,835)after prices surged 36.7 percent in 2016, according to Fang.com, China's biggest real estate website. That's about 70 times the average per capita disposable income in the city; the ratio is less than 25 times for New York City. Median per person rent in Beijing, where most of the estimated 8 million renters are millennials, according to Ziroom.com, has risen 33 percent in the past five years to 2,748 yuan a month in June, equivalent to 58 percent of median income in the city, a survey by E-House China R&amp;D Institute found. The costs often mean that young Chinese workers have to live on the edges of cities, with long, stressful journeys to work. Financial pressures also contribute to young Chinese waiting longer to get married. In Nanjing, a major eastern city, the median age for first marriages rose to 31.6 last year, from 29.9 in 2012, official data showed. RISING EXPECTATIONS ""Sang"" contrasts with the optimism of those who entered adulthood during the years of China's double-digit economic growth in previous decades. That generation was motivated by career prospects and life quality expectations that their parents and grandparents, who had learned to ""eat bitter"" during tougher times, could only dream of. ""Our media and society have shoved too many success stories down our throat,"" said Zhao. ""'Sang' is a quiet protest against society's relentless push for achieving the traditional notion of success. It is about admitting that you just can't make it,"" she told Reuters. It is also a symptom of the lack of channels for frustrated young adults to vent frustration, a survey of 200 Chinese university students by researchers at state think tank Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) found in June. ""The internet itself is a channel for them to release pressure but due to censorship it's impossible to do so by openly venting,"" Xiao Ziyang, a CASS researcher, told Reuters. ""It's necessary for the government to exercise public opinion control to prevent social problems."" Sung Tea founder Xiang Huanzhong, 29, said he expects pressure on young Chinese adults only to grow, citing the aging of the population as a particular burden for the young. Xiang has capitalised on the trend with products named after popular ""sang"" phrases. The chain has single locations in 12 cities after opening its first permanent tea stall in July in Beijing, where a best-selling ""sitting-around-and-waiting-to-die"" matcha milk tea costs 18 yuan. Xiang said he chose tame names for his products so as not to attract censure from authorities, leaning towards the self-deprecating. He took issue with the People's Daily's critical editorial. ""It didn't try to seriously understand at all,"" he said. Wang Hanqi, 21, a student at Nanjing Audit University, sought out Sung Tea after hearing about it on social media. ""I'm a bit disappointed that the names for the tea are not 'sang' enough,"" he said in an interview outside the Beijing stall.

Lamenting that ""protectionism and an inward-looking mentality are on the rise,"" Xi said that ""only openness delivers progress and only inclusiveness sustains such progress."" Xi was speaking to business representatives of the BRICS nations - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - a day before he opens a summit with the leaders of these major emerging markets in the southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen. This will be the ninth summit of the BRICS grouping, which came together about a decade ago to push for an alternative world order that wasn't dominated by Western nations.          From left, South African President Jacob Zuma, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Brazilian President Michel Temer arrive for the opening ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum at the Xiamen International Conference and Exhibition Center in Xiamen in southeastern China's Fujian Province, Sunday, Sept. 3, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, Pool)  Xi said the BRICS nations had led the way in increasing the say of emerging economies and developing countries. ""The law of the jungle where the strong prey on the weak and the zero-sum game are rejected,"" he told the audience, which included Brazilian President Michel Temer and South African President Jacob Zuma. ""We should not ignore problems arising from economic globalization or just complain about them,"" he said. Rather, BRICS nations should work together with other members of the international community to find solutions, he said. China has long been accused of putting up unfair barriers to foreign companies. However, Xi has become a leader who speaks out in favor of globalization at a time when protectionist sentiments are on the rise in Western countries. In January, Xi became the first Chinese president to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he cast his country as a champion of free trade in contrast to the protectionist rhetoric of U.S. President Donald Trump. Yet, foreign companies complain Beijing is reducing access to its markets for electric cars, computer security technology and other promising fields, at the same time as Chinese companies have been on buying sprees abroad. Beijing also faces U.S. and European complaints it is exporting steel, aluminum, solar panels and other goods at improperly low prices, threatening thousands of jobs in other countries. On Sunday, Xi said: ""The Chinese government will continue to encourage Chinese companies to operate and take root in other countries and likewise we also warmly welcome foreign companies to invest and operate in China."" The summit is another chance for Xi to showcase his leadership of a country that wants to project itself as a central pillar of 21st-century global governance. But the event has been overshadowed by North Korea conducting its sixth nuclear test earlier Sunday, apparently its most powerful yet. Though Xi did not address the North's nuclear test in his speech, China's foreign ministry strongly condemned the detonation and urged Pyongyang to ""stop taking erroneous actions that deteriorate the situation."" A Chinese expert on North Korea with the Renmin University in Beijing said North Korea deliberately chose to conduct the test on Sunday in a bid to ""damage the atmosphere"" at the BRICS summit. The latest test means ""the Korean Peninsula situation will be at a stage of new crisis, that means the world must either recognize that (North Korea) possesses nuclear weapons or try to realize a nuclear-free peninsula,"" said Cheng Xiaohe, and assistant professor at Renmin University. Cheng said North Korea has demonstrated through the test that it is not afraid of any pressure, which leaves other parties with few options. ""This issue may be resolved by force or by putting the greatest pressure, including economic pressure, on North Korea in the future. There are not many choices now,"" he said. ___ AP writer Gillian Wong and news assistant Henry Hou in Beijing contributed to this report.

Xi's remarks came in a meeting with South Korean special envoy Lee Hae-chan, who was dispatched to Beijing by new President Moon Jae-in on a mission to reopen contacts and seek a way out of the current impasse that has hit South Korean businesses hard. China ""is committed to resolving any issues through dialogue and coordination, which is in the fundamental interests of both countries and the region,"" Xi was quoted as saying by China's official Xinhua News Agency.

A senior foreign policy adviser to Chinese President Xi stressed the importance of relations with South Korea on Friday as the two countries attempt to mend a rift in ties over the deployment of a U.S. missile-defense system to guard against North Korean threats. (Jason Lee/Pool Photo via AP)  Earlier in the day, Lee met with State Councilor Yang Jiechi, Xi's senior foreign policy adviser, and on Thursday with Foreign Minister Wang Yi. They were believed to have held talks on prospects for containing North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons activities as well as the economic fallout over the deployment in South Korea of the U.S. missile defense system called THAAD. It wasn't clear if THAAD came up in Xi's talks with Lee, during which the Chinese leader sat at the head of the table in a manner usually reserved for meetings with lower-ranking Chinese officials. However, Lee was quoted by Xinhua as saying that South Korea ""understood China's major concerns and was ready to strengthen coordination with China to remove any obstacles to the development of bilateral ties."" Lee earlier said Moon had sent him to China to keep communications open ""at a critical time."" Seoul and Washington have argued that the missile system is aimed at North Korean aggression, while China sees it as a threat to its own security because its radar can peer deep into northeastern China. China is North Korea's biggest economic partner and source of diplomatic support and has come under heavy pressure to use its influence to rein in the North's missile and nuclear activities. China says its influence has been exaggerated and has called on South Korea and the U.S. to end large-scale wargames seen as threatening by North Korea in exchange for the North suspending its missile launches and nuclear tests. Beijing has retaliated against Seoul over THAAD by suspending visits to South Korea by Chinese tour groups and trips to China by South Korean entertainers. South Korean businesses have faced boycotts, especially the retail group Lotte which provided the land on which the missile shield is being constructed. Wang on Thursday reiterated calls for its dismantling. ""We're now at a crossroads in our relations,"" Wang told Lee as he urged the new South Korean administration to make a decision to ""remove the obstacles"" that stand in the way of healthy ties between the two Asian economic powerhouses. In recent weeks Beijing and Seoul have signaled a desire to repair relations following the election of Moon, who has taken a friendlier stance toward China than his conservative predecessor. Although he has sometimes criticized the THAAD deployment, Moon has not said he will remove it. When Xi called Moon last week to congratulate him on his election, Moon reportedly asked Xi for help in ending the economic retaliation that has taken a toll on South Korean businesses. Beijing has maintained its hard line, and in an editorial Thursday, the Communist Party newspaper Global Times said China's opposition ""cannot be traded for the new government's friendly posture toward China."" ""Stopping the deployment of THAAD is the bottom line of China,"" the newspaper said. ""Seoul needs to make a choice between deploying THAAD and resuming Sino-South Korean relations. It should not hope to have it both ways.""

""China stands ready to work with France to move the strategic Sino-French partnership to a higher level,"" Xi said in a congratulatory note, according to the Chinese foreign ministry. Xi recalled that France was the first Western power to establish diplomatic relations with Communist-ruled China in 1964. In an editorial, Chinese daily Global Times hailed Macron's victory as a win against a ""populism trend"" following US President Donald Trump's election last year. ""It may be too early to conclude that today's peak of popularism in world politics is beginning to wane,"" the nationalist newspaper said. ""Years later when we look back upon this election, we may find that France made a wise choice for human civilisation in helping to keep it moving forward at such a crucial time, rather than setting it back,"" it said. Beijing and Paris maintained good relations during the five-year term of President Francois Hollande, after his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, angered China by meeting with the Dalai Lama.

The amendment’s passage by the National People’s Congress’ nearly 3,000 hand-picked delegates, gathered in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, is all but certain. Observers will be looking to see how many delegates abstain from voting as an indication of the reservations the move has encountered even within the political establishment.          The amendment would enable President Xi Jinping to rule indefinitely (Oli Scarff/PA)  The slide towards one-man rule under Mr Xi has fuelled concern that Beijing is eroding efforts to guard against the excesses of autocratic leadership and make economic regulation more stable and predictable. Once passed, the constitutional amendment would upend a system enacted by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1982 to prevent a return to the bloody excesses of a lifelong dictatorship typified by Mao Zedong’s chaotic 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. In a sign of the issue’s sensitivity, the government censors are aggressively scrubbing social media of expressions ranging from “I disagree” to “Xi Zedong”."

Some accuse Cameron of wooing the Chinese for trade deals while ignoring the country's human rights record.At a joint press conference with the Chinese leader at Downing St., Cameron said a strong economic relationship could go alongside some frank disagreements.He said ""the stronger the relationship between our countries, the more we'll be able to have a serious dialogue.""___2:40 p.m.Britain has used the state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping as an occasion to ease visa requirements for other Chinese visitors.Prime Minister David Cameron's office said Wednesday that standard visitor visas will be extended from six months to two years as part of the government's plan to strengthen ties with China.Plans for a new 10-year multiple entry visa were also announced.The extended visa will be introduced in January.Officials say Chinese tourists contribute 500 million pounds ($772 million) to Britain's economy each year.London tourism officials said the new rules should deliver a boost to tourism.___12:20 p.m.Prince William and his wife Kate have shown Chinese President Xi Jinping a special exhibit of British and Chinese technology projects.They were joined Wednesday by film star Jackie Chan as Xi continued a state visit that has included a gala banquet at Buckingham Palace. Xi viewed special zero-emission prototype vehicles including an Aston Martin, a London taxi and a London bus developed by Chinese and British firms.The trip is designed to showcase business opportunities inside Britain as Prime Minister David Cameron courts closer ties with China. Cameron plans to meet Xi later Wednesday and dine with him Thursday at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence.Xi is also thought to be interested in getting some fish and chips at a British pub.___11:45 a.m.Palace officials say a major Chinese firm is offering financial support to Prince William's effort to lead a movement to curtail illegal wildlife trade.Officials said Wednesday the firm Sanpower will work with the Royal Foundation United for Wildlife charity, which is headed by William, his wife Kate and his brother Prince Harry.The announced comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping is on a state visit to Britain.Charity officials say a donation from Sanpower will be used to create two regional ranger training facilities in eastern and southern Africa.

Britain's government is also offering a guarantee.The deal has faced criticism by rights activists who suggest that Prime Minister David Cameron has been courting the Chinese for trade deals while ignoring their human rights record..

Top White House economic aide Larry Kudlow said the high-level efforts continue to resolve the US-China trade war, and follow Trump's recent telephone call with Xi. ""Right now we're having communications at all levels of US and Chinese government,"" Kudlow told CNBC. ""We now know that we will in fact discuss trade at the G20 meeting in Argentina. We didn't know that before but that's a certainty."" Trump is due to arrive in Buenos Aires on November 29 for the G20 summit, which will give him the opportunity for face-to-face meetings to ease the trade tensions. Major US corporations say they are raising prices and face higher costs due to the trade war, in which Washington has imposed steep import duties on more than $250 billion in Chinese goods. China hit back with tariffs on $110 billion in US goods. Duty rates on a $200 billion in imports are due to rise to 25 percent from the current 10 percent, and Trump also is threatening to impose tariffs on another $267 billion of additional Chinese goods."

Italy's coalition government has sent mixed signals over whether it will sign a proposed agreement to join China's trillion-dollar Belt and Road infrastructure investment drive. The initiative aims to expand commerce by building ports, railways and other infrastructure across more than 60 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Europe and Africa. Projects under the initiative have faced complaints that they leave host countries with too much debt, and with too little work going to local companies. Italian Undersecretary of State Guglielmo Picchi tweeted earlier this month that Italy should not sign the agreement. The foreign ministry's statement did not give details of Xi's schedule during the trip. However, the office of French President Emmanuel Macron said Xi will be in France from Sunday through Tuesday.

Markets had initially welcomed the news after it was announced Sunday, with some analysts speculating it could make it easier for him to push through economic reforms. But others wondered whether it would mean less incentive to make those changes.

Karl Marx's ideas of society, economics and politics formed the theoretical base for modern international communismDescribed as one of the most influential figures in human history, Karl Marx is a German revolutionary, sociologist, historian, and economist in the 19th century.Perhaps best known for his critique on capitalism, Marx's radical ideas of society, economics and politics have been collectively understood as Marxism.His ideas formed the theoretical base for modern international communism ideology, which aims for shared ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes.Born in 1818, Marx studied law in Bonn and Berlin and received a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Jena.In 1843, after a brief editor role at a liberal newspaper in Cologne, Marx and his wife Jenny von Westphalen moved to Paris, a hotbed of radical thought.  In 1848, Marx published 'Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei', commonly known as 'The Communist Manifesto' with fellow German thinker Friedrich Engels.It became the most celebrated pamphlet in the socialist movement, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica.The manifesto introduced Marx and Engels' concept of socialism as a natural result of the conflicts inherent in the capitalist system.It states that the whole history of mankind has been a history of class struggles, contests between exploiting and exploited, ruling and oppressed classes.Marx asserted that these would ultimately disappear with the victory of the proletarians - the industrial working class.It closed with the words: 'The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workingmen of all countries, unite!'Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.Revolution subsequently erupted in France, Italy and Austria in the first months of 1848.In June 1849, Marx moved to London and would remain based in the city for the rest of his life.Marx also was the author of the movement's most important book, 'Das Kapital', where in the first volume, Marx aimed to reveal the economic patterns underpinning the capitalist mode of production. Although Marx did not live to publish the second and third parts, they were completed and published by Engels.Marx died on March 14, 1883 and was buried at Highgate Cemetery in London.In China and the Soviet Union, Marxism is enshrined as a 'guiding ideology' in the constitutions of both the party and the state.The founding and ruling political party of modern China - the Communist Party - requires members to adopt the reading of Marxist works and the understanding of Marxist theories as a 'way of life' and a 'spiritual pursuit'.In many Chinese universities, an 'introduction to the basic principles of Marxism' is a mandatory course all students must pass to graduate.   "

The two countries signed Wednesday a memorandum of understanding on cooperation within China's modern Silk Road initiative, with special emphasis on transport connections and energy.

(AP Photo/Armando Franca)  In the EU, however, some influential countries are reluctant to let China invest in the bloc's critical energy and transport infrastructure. During Xi's trip to Spain last week, Portugal's neighbor refused to sign a memorandum of understanding expressing interest in joining the arrangement. The Portuguese government wants China to help develop Sines, Portugal's biggest Atlantic port, and expand national energy company Energias de Portugal overseas, among other things. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa described the memorandum as a ""strategic affirmation"" of Portugal's place in connecting Asia and Europe. No details of the terms of the agreement were published. Portugal has long wanted to make the deep-water port of Sines, 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of Lisbon, a transatlantic logistics hub. China currently has a 23.27 percent stake in Energias de Portugal and is poised to buy control of more than 50 percent. EdP controls EdP Renewables, the third-largest provider of clean energy in the United States, and the deal is likely to catch the attention of the U.S. government. China and Portugal signed 17 cooperation agreements. They included deals on joint technological research in the energy and communications sectors. Trade deals covered the export of Portuguese pork and grapes to China.

A huge sign in the capital, Port Moresby, welcomes Xi Jinping, picturing him gazing beneficently beside Papua New Guinea's leader, and his hotel is decked out with red Chinese lanterns. China's footprint is everywhere, from a showpiece boulevard and international convention center built with Chinese help to bus stop shelters that announce their origins with ""China Aid"" plaques. On the eve of Xi's arrival for a state visit and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, newspapers in the country ran a full-page statement from the Chinese leader. It exhorted Pacific island nations to ""set sail on a new voyage"" of relations with China, which in the space of a generation has transformed from the world's most populous backwater into a major economic power. With both actions and words, Xi has a compelling message for the South Pacific's fragile island states, long both propped up and pushed around by U.S. ally Australia: they now have a choice of benefactors. With the exception of Papua New Guinea, those island nations are not part of APEC, but the leaders of many of them have traveled to Port Moresby and will meet with Xi. The APEC meeting, meanwhile, is Xi's to dominate. Headline-hogging leaders such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump are not attending. Trump's stand-in, Vice President Mike Pence, is staying in Cairns in Australia's north and flying into Papua New Guinea each day. Australia's new prime minister, Scott Morrison, the country's fifth leader in five years, is barely known abroad. ""President Xi Jinping is a good friend of Papua New Guinea,"" its prime minister, Peter O'Neill, told reporters. ""He has had a lot of engagement with Papua New Guinea and I've visited China 12 times in the last seven years.""

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)  Pacific island nations, mostly tiny, remote and poor, rarely figure prominently on the world stage but have for several years been diligently courted by Beijing as part of its global effort to finance infrastructure that advances its economic and diplomatic interests. Papua New Guinea with about 8 million people is by far the most populous, and with its extensive tropical forests and oil and gas reserves is an obvious target for economic exploitation. Six of the 16 Pacific states still have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, a sizeable bloc within the rapidly dwindling number of nations that recognize the island regarded as a renegade province by Beijing. Chinese aid and loans could flip those six into its camp. A military foothold in the region would be an important geostrategic boost for China, though its purported desire for a base has so far been thwarted. Beijing's assistance comes without the oversight and conditions that Western nations and organizations such as the World Bank or International Monetary Fund impose. It is promising $4 billion of finance to build the first national road network in Papua New Guinea, which could be transformative for the mountainous nation. But experts warn there could also be big costs later on: unsustainable debt, white elephant showpieces and social tensions from a growing Chinese diaspora. ""China's engagement in infrastructure in PNG shouldn't be discounted. It should be encouraged but it needs to be closely monitored by the PNG government to make sure it's effective over the long term,"" said Jonathan Pryke, a Papua New Guinea expert at the Lowy Institute, a think tank in Sydney. ""The benefits of these projects, because a lot of them are financed by loans, only come from enhanced economic output over a long time to be able to justify paying back these loans,"" he said. ""The history of infrastructure investment in PNG shows that too often there is not enough maintenance going on,"" Pryke said. ""There's a build, neglect, rebuild paradigm in PNG as opposed to build and maintain which is far more efficient."" Some high-profile Chinese projects in Papua New Guinea have already run into problems. A promised fish cannery hasn't materialized after several years and expansion of a port in Lae, the major commercial center, was botched and required significant rectification work. Two of the Chinese state companies working in the country, including the company responsible for the port expansion, were until recently blacklisted from World Bank-financed projects because of fraud or corruption. Xi's newspaper column asserted China is the biggest foreign investor in Papua New Guinea, a statement more aspirational than actual. Its involvement is currently dwarfed by the investment of a single company- ExxonMobil's $19 billion natural gas extraction and processing facility. Australia, the former colonial power in Papua New Guinea, remains its largest donor of conventional foreign aid. Its assistance, spread across the country and aimed at improving bare bones public services and the capacity of government, is less visible. But its approach is shifting in response to China's moves. In September, the Australian government announced it would pay for what is typically a commercial venture - a high-speed undersea cable linking Australia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands that promises to make the internet and telecommunications in the two island countries faster, more reliable and less expensive. Earlier this month, Australia announced more than $2 billion of funding for infrastructure and trade finance aimed at Pacific island nations and also agreed to joint development of a naval base in Papua New Guinea, heading off feared Chinese involvement. It is also boosting its diplomatic presence, opening more embassies to be represented in every Pacific island state. ""The APEC meeting is shaping up to be a faceoff between China and Australia for influence in the Pacific,"" said Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch. That might seem a positive development for the region, but Pearson cautioned that competition for Papua New Guinea's vast natural resources has in the past had little positive impact on the lives of its people. ""Sadly exploitation of resources in PNG has fueled violent conflict, abuse and environmental devastation,"" she said. ___ Associated Press writer Jim Gomez contributed to this report.

516,"Stock market rout another blow to fading ""Chinese Dream""",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3159888/Stock-market-rout-blow-fading-Chinese-Dream.html," 22:01 BST, 13 July 2015 ","Stock market rout another blow to fading ""Chinese Dream"" By Reuters   Published: 22:01 BST, 13 July 2015  |  Updated: 22:01 BST, 13 July 2015                e-mail         By John Ruwitch and Brenda GohCHANGZHOU/WENZHOU, China, July 14 (Reuters) - About a week after Shanghai's main stock index broke above 4,000 points in April, the leading newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party weighed in with patriotic glee.Not only was the bull run just beginning, said a widely-read, and later ridiculed, editorial from the People's Daily.In the longer term, it continued, the ""Chinese Dream"" of rising prosperity and security championed by President Xi Jinping would be reflected in capital markets, creating ""huge"" investment opportunities.The stock market turmoil in the last month has shattered that particular dream for many small-time players, though the risk of contagion from a relatively narrow class of retail investors who dominate Chinese equities appears small for now.Beijing had earlier stepped in to address the property boom and mounting bad debts, two potential danger zones in the economy, helping to bring down house prices and shift local government debt to longer term maturities to avert a crisis.Now it must find ways to change economic gear from massive stimulus to consumer-led growth, and the slump in stocks has not helped.Zhou Sujuan, a 44-year-old manager at a private medical device company in Wenzhou, a coastal city 450 km (280 miles) south of Shanghai known for its entrepreneurial spirit, lost 2 million yuan ($322,186) in the selloff.""This has caused me a lot of heartache. It will take some time to recover,"" she said.The scope of Xi's vision of the future goes well beyond a few million people investing in shares, and is key to maintaining stability among the population of 1.3 billion.A volley of government policies and edicts has turned the stock market around, at least for now. Despite recent sharp falls, values are roughly double what they were a year ago.Delivering on the broader promise is likely to prove harder, as a series of interviews with Chinese people from a range of backgrounds underlines.Recent data show the scale of the challenge.Sluggish property, weak consumer spending, factory gate prices falling for over three years and local governments laden with $3 trillion in debt mean the economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century this year.China's success or otherwise in reviving growth is one of the biggest factors hanging over the global economy, with implications for companies across continents and industries, from automakers and luxury goods makers to miners and farmers.""PROFOUND AND PERMANENT"" DAMAGE?The measures the government enacted to halt the stock market's slide have raised questions about the Communist Party's commitment to reforms needed to achieve a more open and dynamic economy, driven by domestic demand.""The massive state intervention, especially preventing major shareholders from selling shares and going after short sellers, has damaged financial sector reform in profound and permanent ways,"" said Victor Shih, associate professor at the University of California San Diego, who studies China's finance policy.By halting initial public offerings, for example, Beijing has closed off one funding option for non-state-owned businesses that are expected to eventually lead the economy.One such company belongs to Ren Zhengming, a 54-year-old who has run his manufacturing business in Changzhou, an hour northwest of Shanghai by bullet train, for more than 20 years.Changzhou Wujin Zhengda Vehicle Industry Co Ltd makes machined metal parts for measuring instruments, and serves major sectors of the economy from cars to homebuilding.Like many in Chinese manufacturing, Ren has seen costs rise steadily, exports soften and domestic demand growth stall. He has about 100 employees, from up to 200 a few years ago, and profit margins are down from around 25 percent five years ago.""If we can guarantee 10 percent now that would be pretty good,"" he said. ""These last few months, it's been just enough to pay for our workforce.""Ren's experience is typical of thousands of small manufacturers, who have become less competitive as a stronger yuan currency hit exports and rising labour and other input costs eroded profit margins.Growth in private sector investment has been slowing in recent years.Xi and Premier Li Keqiang have set out to tackle the effects of years of growth-at-all-costs development in the decade or so before they took office, reforming the foreign exchange regime, liberalising other prices and trying to rein in soaring debt.But that brings with it short-term pain, both for Chinese firms like Ren's and multinationals that have invested heavily in China as a growth market.""With this set of leaders in office it's fairly hard to be optimistic about our business,"" Ren told Reuters.FOREIGN COMPANIES FEEL PINCHOptimism about the Chinese economy has slipped significantly among U.S. businesses operating here, according to a March survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.Some European firms are preparing for lay-offs amid weaker economic growth and slow reforms, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in June.Prices of commodities from copper to crude oil, key elements in construction and other industries, are down, in part because Chinese appetite for raw materials has weakened.Economies like Australia and Brazil are feeling the effects.Ren says he's too old to do anything radical to reshape his business. The future of the company will depend on his son-in-law, who is gradually taking charge.""All we can do is build a platform for younger people.""Many of China's brightest young people, however, are struggling to find work.The number of college graduates in China reached a record high of 7.49 million this year, an increase of 220,000 from 2014. Hu Xiao is one of them.A 21-year-old from the southern province of Yunnan, Hu majored in accounting at Dongbei University of Finance and Economics in the northeastern port city of Dalian.This year's job hunting season, from April to June, was ""one of the toughest in history"", Xinhua said, and Hu joined the growing mass of educated youth who don't have work, despite applying for more than 150 positions.""I think I should be able to find a job, it's just that it may not be a very good job,"" she said.While work for graduates is hard to find, unemployment, a key benchmark of social stability, remains low at around 4 percent, although some officials doubt the reliability of that figure. The labour ministry has warned that authorities cannot be ""blindly optimistic"" as the pace of job creation slows.Wage and income growth have also been flagging.SERVICES BOOST?Xiao Peng, a tech entrepreneur in Shanghai who goes by the name XP, concedes exports and the type of investment that powered the economy in the 2000s are slowing, but he sees cause for optimism.XP's latest venture, Xish International, runs an app that promotes weekend activities, riding rapid changes in consumer behaviour in China.""You know what Chinese did on weekends during the last decade; they played mahjong, watched TV and maybe went to eat at a restaurant, and that's it,"" he said. ""This younger generation, they want to spend money more on experiences.""XP's one-man startup has grown into a 120-employee company in under two years.""This government wants people to consume to drive the economy,"" XP said. ""I'm pretty optimistic.""His rosier outlook is based partly on forecasts that in the next 15 years, 400 million Chinese will move into cities.But there is also evidence that Chinese consumers are cautious, in part because of debt.Zhang Yingyi, a 30-year-old administrative assistant and mother of a three-year-old daughter, works full time at an international exchange programme in Shanghai.She and her husband earn reasonable salaries that put them in China's emerging middle class. They live in a 2.5 million yuan ($400,000) apartment and recently bought a Mercedes-Benz B180 to shorten his commute.But the couple's spending power is hobbled by debt for the flat and car, and Shanghai's high living costs eat away at their monthly income. Zhang says her husband does not drink or smoke and they hardly buy any clothes.""I don't feel like I spend that much but there's never money left,"" she said.Like many Chinese whose investment opportunities have been limited, what equity they do have is tied up in their apartment.PROPERTY, DEBT WEIGH ON CHINAChina's real estate market has been softening for around two years, as Beijing enacted restrictive measures to take the steam out of what many thought was becoming a dangerous bubble.Sales have slowed, new construction has dropped off sharply and banks have become increasingly cautious about lending to developers and home-buyers. Housing prices fell in June for the second month in a row, two surveys showed earlier this month.That slowdown impacts not just developers, but other industries from home appliance firms to steel makers. Some economists estimate housing and housing-related sectors account for about 30 percent of gross domestic product.There are signs activity is starting to pick up, and ironically, stock market volatility could support property by encouraging people to avoid equities and invest in real estate.Beside housing, Chinese debt is also choking off growth.Worries about a potential crisis sparked by local government debt have largely subsided as a result of a swap deal this year that enabled localities to convert short-term loans into longer-term bonds, but the arrears are still constraining investment.Much local debt dates back to a massive stimulus package that pulled China out of a growth slowdown in 2009, and makes it harder for Beijing to spark activity in this way again.NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOMFew predict Armageddon for the Chinese economy, even after the stock market rout.While annual growth is relatively sedate, the $10 trillion economy is several times its size when it last grew slower, in 1990, and producing far more by virtue of scale.In the first quarter China ran a current account surplus of $75.6 billion, while the government is sitting on a war chest of well over $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.So far the government remains sanguine about prospects for re-shaping the economy, and sources close to the leadership told Reuters that top leaders do not see the stock market's troubles as a crisis.But its handling of the market turmoil has been openly criticised by some Chinese in a rare expression of dissatisfaction at the Communist Party's economic stewardship.Zhou from Wenzhou, who lost her bet on shares, had hoped to buy a house in a different district to get her daughter into a better school. That dream will have to wait.Zhou concedes she was greedy, but also blames state-run entities for heavy-handed tactics in the market.""The government is unreasonable,"" she said. ""It is forever a planned market, a planned economy.""

518,China files trade complaint against US over steel tariffs,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5598095/China-files-trade-complaint-against-US-steel-tariffs.html," 09:25 BST, 10 April 2018 "," GENEVA (AP) - China has filed a World Trade Organization complaint challenging U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hike on imported steel and aluminum, the trade body said Tuesday. The tariff spat is one element of a wide-ranging trade dispute between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping's government. Trump also has threatened to increase duties on $50 billion of Chinese goods in a separate conflict over technology policy. China has requested 60 days of consultations with the United States on the steel and aluminum dispute, according to the WTO. If that fails, the next step could be for Beijing to request a ruling from a panel of trade experts.

China's President Xi Jinping promised to cut auto import taxes, open China's markets further and improve conditions for foreign companies in a speech Tuesday that called for international cooperation against a backdrop of a spiraling dispute with Washington over trade and technology. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)  Beijing says Trump's decision to impose additional duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent aluminum violate international trade rules. Steel and aluminum are among Chinese industries in which supply exceeds demand. China's trading partners complain its mills are exporting their surplus at improperly low prices, threatening jobs in the United States and Europe. The United States buys little Chinese steel and aluminum following earlier tariff hikes meant to offset what Washington says are improper subsidies to producers. But economists said Beijing responded in order to show it would defend itself. China's government issued a $3 billion list of U.S. goods including pork, apples and steel pipes on March 23 that it said might be targeted for retaliation if Trump fails to negotiate a settlement to the dispute over steel and aluminum charges.

International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach, left, talks to Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Thursday, Jan. 31, 2019. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, Pool)  Beijing received the games by attrition, winning over Almaty, Kazakhstan, after a half-dozen European bidders dropped out, discouraged by soaring costs and taxpayer backlash. Its win was based largely on the city's organizational prowess, financial backing, and ability to reuse existing venues. Beijing claims strong public support for the games, although the ruling Communist Party severely restricts public participation in such decision-making. Beijing's win came despite concerns about air pollution and the city's long, dry winter that will require it to rely almost entirely on man-made snow. The Nordic events will be held in the Zhaolong ski area in neighboring Hebei province, which generally receives some natural snow cover. The government has also been criticized for its record on human rights, including the internment of hundreds of thousands of Muslims in political indoctrination camps. Yet, with fewer countries willing to bid on the games, Beijing appears a safe bet for the International Olympic Council. After being rejected in yet another public vote, the IOC is down to two candidates to host the 2026 Games - Stockholm, and a joint Italian bid from Milan and Cortina D'Ampezzo.

Donald Trump (left) was accused of racism on Twitter after appearing to mimick the accent of Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) as he recalled a conversation they had about drug dealers         Twitters users were quick to call out Trump on his apparent accent change during his press conference in the Rose Garden He said he asked the President to put the prescription pain-killer Fentanyl on their criminal list of drugs. Trump told reporters: 'With their criminal list a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called ""how about a fine?""'.However his accent appeared to change and soften when he recalled what President Xi told him in response to a question, causing Twitter to go into meltdown.

Trump spoke at a press conference and was speaking about trade talks with China when he appeared to use a Chinese accent          Twitter went into overdrive when Trump's dialect changed as he mimicked President Jinping                                                               'End of problem.'

521,Italian soccer federation to explore more ties with China,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6838987/Italian-soccer-federation-explore-ties-China.html," 12:20 BST, 22 March 2019 "," ROME (AP) - Playing the Italian Super Cup or Italian Cup final in China will be among the proposals discussed when a delegation linked to the visit of President Xi Jinping meets with the Italian soccer federation on Sunday. The meeting with China Media Group head Shen Haixiong will also focus on TV content, collaboration over developing young Chinese players in Italy and instruction for using the video assistant referee. The Italian federation hopes to play games in China within the next three years, according to a meeting agenda seen by The Associated Press on Friday, although the federation said moving Serie A games to China is not up for consideration. There could also be friendly matches between national teams and courses for Chinese coaches. There are already strong soccer ties between the countries, with former Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro recently succeeding former Italy coach Marcello Lippi as coach of China. Cannavaro's first game was a 1-0 loss to Thailand in the opening match of the four-nation China Cup on Thursday.

This year's Italian Super Cup was played in Saudi Arabia as part of a deal with Saudi Arabia's General Sports Authority that calls for two more of the matches over the next four years to be played in the Gulf country. Xi was received with full red-carpet honors by Italian counterpart Sergio Mattarella on Friday, launching a two-day visit aimed at deepening ties through an ambitious infrastructure program that has raised suspicions among Italy's U.S. and European allies. Zhang Jindong, the owner of Suning and Inter Milan, accompanied Xi during his visit and took advantage of the opportunity to meet with Inter's Italian managers while in Rome. On Thursday, Inter announced a preseason tour of Asia, which could include up to two matches in China, plus one in Singapore. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports          Chinese President Xi Jinping, left, and Italian President Sergio Mattarella during a business forum inside the Quirinale Presidential, in Rome, Friday, March 22, 2019.

Share this articleShare Just like a mirror to the Xi-Kim meetings held in China this week and in March, the fathers of the two country's current leaders sat side by side, showing their bond of Communist brotherhood.They were listening to the future Chinese first lady Peng Liyuan, then merely 20 years old, singing North Korean folk song 'flower-selling girl' in Mandarin and Korean.The video was filmed during Kim Jong-il's first visit to China in June, 1983. Xi Zhongxun, said to be good friends with Kim Jong-il, was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China. The war veteran, then 69 years old, was among a number of top Chinese leaders to receive Kim Jong-il, then 42 years old.              Kim Jong-un (left) became the North Korean leader after Kim Jong-ill (right) died in 2011              Xi Jinping (left), son of Chinese veteran Xi Zhongxun (right), became China's leader in 2012         Kim Jong-un and Xi Jinping meet for the second time in two months in the city of Dalian, ChinaKim Jong-il visited China as the heir apparent of North Korea to succeed his father Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea. He was also the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.His 1983 visit was unofficial and never reported in China, but its details - including the clip of the song - were revealed in a North Korean documentary, lengthily named 'Leader of the Workers' Party of Korea and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party Comrade Kim Jong-il's visit to China'.The 90-minute propaganda film shows Kim Jong-il travelling from North Korea to China's border city Dandong on a green train - just like what his son did in March, which earned Kim junior his latest nickname 'fatty on the train' in China.It's said that Kim Jong-il had such a fear of flying that he visited China and Russia in a private armoured train.Unveiled in 1962 with its first flight the following year, the IL-62 became commonly used around the world and continued being manufactured until 1994. From Dandong, Kim Jong-il carried on his 1983 journey by train to China's capital city Beijing where he was received by Xi Zhongxun as well as Hu Yaobang, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.The Chinese leaders showed great hospitality to Kim Jong-il, taking him to the ancient imperial palace, driving him around in symbolic Red Flag limousines and treating him to lavish banquets.Peng was one of the performances at an entertainment gala Beijing set up to welcome Kim Jong-il. Back then, Xi Jinping and Peng Liyuan were yet to be introduced to each other. The two, one successful politician and one popular singer, started dating in 1986 and got married in 1987.          Peng Liyuan (circled) was among a number of artists performing for Kim Jong-il in 1983              Peng Liyuan (pictured), China's first lady, is a popular singer and once an entertainment soldierFrom Beijing, the North Korean leader travelled southwards to coastal city Qingdao where he visited the famous Tsingtao Beer factory; ancient capital Nanjing where he climbed onto the monumental Yangtze River bridge; and scenic Hangzhou where he took a boat journey on West Lake, as the film shows.He then made a stop in commercial hub Shanghai, where visited the birthplace of the Communist Party of China.From Shanghai, Kim travelled back to capital Beijing to hold a meeting with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who was the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central Military Commission.In the years to follow, Kim Jong-il paid seven official state visits to China from 2000 to 2011, all of which were conducted after his father's death.   But it was his first unofficial visit in 1983 that carried the most surreal connection to the Beijing-Pyongyang relation today.          Xi Jinping and Peng Liyuan arrive for a concert held for G20 leaders in Hamburg in July, 2017         Xi Jinping and Peng Liyuan meet Catherine Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William in 2015Kim Jong-un, who's the spitting image of his late father, visited China for the first time in March this year by train, which was also his first overseas state visit since taking the office in 2011.In Beijing he met with China's president Xi Jinping, Xi Zhongxun's son, and China's first lady, Peng Li Yuan, who sang for his late father more than three decades ago.A bit over a month later earlier this week, Kim Jong-un travelled to China again - but this time on his private jet - for a surprise visit to meet President Xi Jinping just weeks ahead of the North Korean dictator's planned summit with Donald Trump.The pictures of Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un taking a stroll side by side and sitting next to each other during a meeting echoed what their fathers did in 1983 in an interesting and surreal manner. Why is Kim Jong-un called 'Kim Fatty III' in China?  There are several different theories on the origin of the nickname.  Here are the two popular ones according to Chinese media.The first one deprives from the three-generation lineage of North Korean leadership. Apparently all of the three leaders on North Korea's history are deemed 'fat' by Chinese people. Kim Il-sung, the founder of the communist country, is called 'Kim Fatty I'. His son, Kim Jong-il, is 'Kim Fatty II' while Kim Jong-un is 'Kim Fatty III'.The second theory says because Kim Jong-un is the third son of Kim Jong-il and he is fat, he is called 'Kim Fatty III"".                     Kim Jong-un attends a meeting with Xi Jinping in Dalian during Kim's second visit to China         The two leaders take a seaside stroll during their two-day meeting in the coastal city of Dalian"
523,China lunar probe sheds light on the 'dark' side of the moon,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6551423/Chinese-spacecraft-makes-landing-moons-far-side.html," 04:31 BST, 3 January 2019 "," BEIJING (AP) - China's burgeoning space program achieved a lunar milestone on Thursday: landing a probe on the mysterious and misnamed ""dark"" side of the moon. Exploring the cosmos from that far side of the moon, which people can't see from Earth, could eventually help scientists learn more about the early days of the solar system and maybe even the birth of the universe's first stars. Three nations - the United States, the former Soviet Union and more recently China - all have sent spacecraft to the side of the moon that faces Earth, but this landing is the first on the far side. That side has been observed many times from lunar orbit, but never up close. The China National Space Administration said the 10:26 a.m. touchdown of the Chang'e 4 craft has ""opened up a new chapter in human lunar exploration."" A photo taken at 11:40 a.m. and sent back by Chang'e 4 shows a small crater and a barren surface that appears to be illuminated by a light from the lunar explorer. Its name comes from that of a Chinese goddess who, according to legend, has lived on the moon for millennia. One challenge of sending a probe to the moon's far side is communicating with it from Earth, so China launched a relay satellite in May to enable Chang'e 4 to send back information.          In this photo provided Jan. 3, 2019, by China National Space Administration via Xinhua News Agency, the first image of the moon's far side taken by China's Chang'e-4 probe. A Chinese spacecraft on Thursday, Jan. 3, made the first-ever landing on the far side of the moon, state media said. The lunar explorer Chang'e 4 touched down at 10:26 a.m., China Central Television said in a brief announcement at the top of its noon news broadcast.(China National Space Administration/Xinhua News Agency via AP)  The mission highlights China's growing ambitions to rival the U.S., Russia and Europe in space, and more broadly, to cement its position as a regional and global power. ""The space dream is part of the dream to make China stronger,"" President Xi Jinping said after becoming the country's leader in 2013. Chinese media and officials hailed the Dec. 8 launch of Chang'e 4 as one of the nation's major achievements in 2018. The public was kept in suspense about the landing itself for more than an hour after it occurred, with state broadcaster CCTV announcing it at the top of the noon news. By that time, speculation already had begun spreading on social media in China and overseas. ""On the whole, China's space technology still lags behind the West, but with the landing on the far side of the moon, we have raced to the front,"" said Hou Xiyun, a professor at Nanjing University's school of astronomy and space science. He added that China has Mars, Jupiter and asteroids in its sights: ""There's no doubt that our nation will go farther and farther."" The landing was ""a big deal"" because it used an engineering technique of the spacecraft itself choosing a safe place to touch down in treacherous terrain, something called autonomous hazard avoidance, said Purdue University lunar and planetary scientist Jay Melosh. He recalled mentioning the idea of such a technique for an unfunded NASA lunar mission about eight years ago, only to be told it wasn't doable at the time. ""The moon is more challenging to land on than Mars,"" Melosh said. ""On Mars, you can pick out smooth areas."" In 2013, the predecessor spacecraft Chang'e 3 made the first moon landing since the former Soviet Union's Luna 24 in 1976. The United States is the only country to successfully send astronauts to the moon - 2019 will mark the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing - although China is considering a crewed mission too. For now, it plans to send a Chang'e 5 probe to the moon next year and have it return to Earth with samples - also not done since the Soviet mission in 1976. The moon's far side is sometimes called the ""dark side"" in popular culture because it is always unseen from Earth and is relatively unknown, not because it lacks sunlight. Chang'e 4, a combined lander and rover, will make astronomical observations and probe the composition of the soil. The spacecraft landed in the South Pole-Aitken basin, the oldest known impact zone. Scientists want to know how old - somewhere between 3.9 billion and 4.4 billion years old - to better understand a period in the solar system's history called the late heavy bombardment. That's when space rocks were careening off each other and crashing into moons and planets, including Earth. Knowing the age and chemical composition of this crash zone would help understand Earth's ancient history better, said Purdue's Melosh. Chang'e 4 could also contribute to radio astronomy. ""The far side of the moon is a rare, quiet place that is free from interference from radio signals from Earth,"" mission spokesman Yu Guobin said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. ""This probe can fill the gap of low-frequency observation in radio astronomy and will provide important information for studying the origin of stars and nebula evolution."" Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb said that in the future, it may be possible to see much farther - and thus earlier - into the universe from the far side because the moon itself will block interfering radio signals from Earth. From the far side, scientists may eventually be able to peer back to 50 million to 100 million years after the Big Bang, when the first stars were born - or even earlier, he said. China conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, following Russia and the U.S. It has put two space stations into orbit and plans to launch a Mars rover in the mid-2020s. Its space program suffered a rare setback last year with the failed launch of its Long March 5 rocket. ""Building a space power is a dream that we persistently pursue,"" said Wu Weiren, the chief designer of the China Lunar Exploration Project, speaking with CCTV at the Beijing Aerospace Flight and Control Center. ""And we're gradually realizing it."" ___ Associated Press writer Yanan Wang and researcher Shanshan Wang in Beijing and Science Writer Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.

524,Xi: China wants to expand sprawling infrastructure project,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6966219/Xi-China-wants-expand-sprawling-infrastructure-project.html," 08:17 BST, 27 April 2019 "," BEIJING (AP) - President Xi Jinping called for more countries to join China's sprawling infrastructure-building initiative as other leaders expressed support Saturday for a project Washington worries is increasing Beijing's strategic influence. Xi spoke at a gathering of leaders to celebrate the multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, his signature foreign project. The upbeat tone of the two-day forum, at which Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders praised the initiative, is a setback for the Trump administration, which is trying to discourage other countries from participating. Xi promised Friday to promote high financial, environmental and other standards in response to complaints about debt and other problems. That has the potential to heighten tensions with Washington by making the initiative more attractive to additional participants. ""We need to encourage the full participation of more countries and companies,"" the Chinese president said at the event at a government conference center outside Beijing. Xi tried to dispel complaints Belt and Road does little for developing countries that have borrowed from Beijing to build ports, railways and other facilities. Xi said his government wants to ""deliver benefits to all."" Additional agreements worth a total of $64 billion were signed during the forum, Xi said. He gave no details of what those agreements covered or who signed them.          Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks during a press conference at the closing of the Belt and Road Forum at Yanqi Lake on the outskirts of Beijing, Saturday, April 27, 2019. Xi called Saturday for more countries to join China's sprawling infrastructure-building initiative in the face of U.S. opposition to a project Washington worries is increasing Beijing's strategic influence. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)  A joint statement issued by leaders at the meeting expressed appreciation for the ""important opportunities"" created by Belt and Road and said it offers ""potential for economic and social development."" Participants included the presidents of the Philippines, Kenya and Egypt, prime ministers of Italy, Greece and Pakistan and other officials from Indonesia, Germany and other countries. Other governments welcomed the initiative launched in 2013 to increase trade by building ports, railways and other infrastructure across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. But some are struggling to repay Chinese loans, which has fueled complaints about a possible ""debt trap."" Critics also complain too much of the work goes to Chinese state-owned companies and the initiative might lead to corruption and environmental damage. The United States, Russia, Japan and India worry Beijing is eroding their influence. American officials have warned other governments about potential debt problems and China's possible political motives. Xi's government is trying to revive momentum for Belt and Road after the number of new projects slumped last year. That followed official announcements that Chinese lenders would examine borrowers more closely and concerns by some governments about Beijing's rising influence. On Friday, Xi promised to embrace international financial, environmental and other standards. He pledged to work more closely with multinational entities and to open projects dominated by Chinese state-owned companies wider to private and foreign contractors. Despite U.S. opposition, the Chinese government says the number of countries that have signed agreements to support the initiative has risen to 115 from 65. Beijing scored a diplomatic coup in March when Italy, a member of the Group of Seven major economies, signed an agreement to support Belt and Road. On Friday, Putin said Belt and Road fits with Moscow's initiative to develop a common market with four of its neighbors. Their joint statement emphasized the importance of ""promoting green development"" and ""addressing the challenges of environmental protection and climate change."" The Chinese leader repeated his promise to adopt ""widely accepted rules and standards"" and encourage Belt and Road countries to follow global standards for project development, purchasing and operations. ""We welcome the participation of multilateral and international financial institutions in Belt and Road investment and financing, and we encourage third market cooperation,"" said Xi. ""With involvement of multiple stake holders we can surely deliver benefits to all."" Xi's promises on debt, transparency and anti-corruption ""will be well received by some BRI countries and outside observers,"" Kelsey Broderick of Eurasia Group in a report. Others including the European Union ""will wait to see actual implementation."" Chinese lenders have provided $440 billion in financing for Belt and Road projects, the country's central bank governor, Yi Gang, said Thursday. Beijing is ordering Chinese state-owned companies to pay more attention to local economic development, benefits for local residents and environmental protection, the chairman of the Cabinet agency that oversees national-level government industries said Thursday, according to a transcript on the agency website. Xi's government also has tried to defuse tensions with Belt and Road participants by renegotiating debts or offering other concessions. Ethiopia announced Wednesday that Beijing had forgiven interest payments owed by the northeast African nation through the end of 2018.

Previous reports have claimed the J-20's design comes from stolen plans obtained by hackers of the F-22 (pictured left) and F-35 Raptors (pictured right)China trailed the world in aerospace technology 20 years ago, he told a press conference, but is now at the leading edge.Swift, stealthy, and armed with long-range missiles, the new J-20s represent a leap forward in China's ability to project power in Asia and compete in capabilities with the United States.Beijing is seeking to modernise and upgrade its military both to protect its borders and project power into regions such as the South China Sea, a resource-rich waterway where it has disputes with several neighbours.         The air show will showcase China's aerial strength. Along with the latest J-20 stealth jet will be the seven-strong J-10 fighter jets of China's Bayi Aerobatic Team (pictured)  THE J-20 STEALTH FIGHTER    China's new war plane is swift, stealthy, and armed with long-range missiles.Experts say the plane represents a leap forward in China's ability to project power in Asia, and will compete with US military technology.The stealth fighter will be showcased at China's airshow in Guandong this week (1-6 November).Beijing is looking to upgrade its military as part of efforts to strengthen its borders and exert more control over disputed territories.   China's only international aerospace exhibition, held biennially in the southern city of Zhuhai, this year boasts its largest-ever display of military hardware and aircraft, with 11 exhibition halls, 430,000 square metres of indoor and outdoor viewing area, and 151 aircraft from 700 exhibitors from 42 countries and regions.The show will also see the debut of the Y-20 transport aircraft, which can move heavy loads and carry out airlifts to assist military activities.Chinese-made military assault vehicles, anti-aircraft missile systems, drones and fighter jets stood on display outside the exhibition centre.AVIC chief Tan said his company had business in 80 countries and territories, with annual overseas sales exceeding 80 billion yuan ($11.8bn / £9.7bn).The firm will firmly remember its 'sacred mission' to serve China, he said. It would carry out the strategic plan of the Communist party, the government and the People's Liberation Army and 'closely unite around the core leadership of comrade Xi Jinping'.AVIC, which earlier this year acquired British cabin interior supplier AIM Altitude, would 'persistently struggle' to realise the dream of a great Chinese air force and a strong military, he added.         The airshow, in Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong Province, will provide a platform for Beijing to flex its long-range military muscle to the public and watching nations around the world.

It was also reported in September that a Chinese firm claimed to have developed radar technology capable of detecting stealth jets (stock image used)       The leaked images revealed the battle ship's progress, with signs of portals on the stern for sensors and weapons and up to 128 vertical launch system cells for missiles.It was also reported in September that a Chinese firm claimed to have developed radar technology capable of detecting stealth jets.Called the quantum radar, the technology was reportedly created by Intelligent Perception Technology, a branch of defence and electronics firm CETC.They firm claims it is capable of detecting a target at a range of 60 miles and was successfully tested last month.China has pushed for dominance in the South China Sea, following a number of contentious claims over who owns territory in the region. The two major island chains in the region, the Spratlys and the Paracels, have become central to the international argument, causing tensions to rise.Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines all have claims on the region, but China has surged ahead with expansive military operations, including the building of its own islands in disputed spots to stake its claim and bolster a military presence. CHINA'S WARSHIP TO BE A 'GAME CHANGER'           Asia's most powerful warship has been shrouded in mystery since construction began last year at the Jiangnan Changxing shipyards. Called Type 005 destroyer, this vessel is said to be armed with electromagnetic railguns that can shoot down missiles and attack land targets (pictured is an artist impression of Type 005)Leaked images show the Type 005 destroyer should launch late 2017 or early 2018.It has a full displacement of over 14,000 tons.And the images show the bow and stern are finished.         Now, leaked images give a glimpse of the battle ship's progress, which reveals four portals on the stern for sensors and weapons and up to 128 vertical launch system cells for missiles (pictured is an artist impression of Type 005)The bow area appears to be extremely hydrodynamic hull, endure high speeds, have stealth capabilities and is fitted with an enclosed deck.And the stern is where the creators packed all of the technology.This area has at least four sections that hold sensors and weapons like towed array sonar, variable depth sonar, towed torpedo decoys and active torpedo defenses.Because the ship is 175 meters long and is built with large displacement, the Type 005 will be capable of carry numerous helicopters at once and other technologies such as drones and underwater vehicles.   "
